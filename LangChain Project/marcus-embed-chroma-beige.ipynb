Job turnover and voluntary quits reportedly fell in recent weeks, and hiring difficulties eased in consumer services sectors such as retail, food services, and hospitality. Contacts reported strong competition for labor and difficulties attracting experienced talent in health care, legal services, manufacturing, and skilled trades. Several real estate firms and mortgage providers reported reducing the number of open positions in response to moderating demand and noted that recent hiring freezes and layoffs in the technology sector improved the size and quality of the applicant pool. Contacts in Alaska and Hawaii continued to report challenges filling entry-level positions, partly due to elevated shelter costs. Several employers noted that, despite overall economic uncertainty, they plan to maintain current employment levels to avoid the hiring challenges they have experienced throughout the pandemic.  \\nPeriod: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.\\nWages grew further, albeit at a slower pace. Workers continued to ask for higher pay and end-of-year bonuses in response to elevated living costs.
