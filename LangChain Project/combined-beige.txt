Overall economic activity was relatively unchanged since the previous report. Five Districts reported slight or modest increases in overall activity, six noted no change or slight declines, and one cited a significant decline. On balance, contacts generally expected little growth in the months ahead. Consumer spending increased slightly, with some retailers reporting more robust sales over the holidays. Other retailers noted that high inflation continued to reduce consumers' purchasing power, particularly among low- and moderate-income households.

Tourism contacts reported moderate to robust activity augmented by strong holiday travel. Manufacturers indicated that activity declined modestly on average, and, in many Districts, reported that supply chain disruptions had eased. Housing markets continued to weaken, with sales and construction declining across Districts. Commercial real estate activity slowed slightly, on average, with more notable weakening in the office market. Nonfinancial services firms experienced stable demand on balance. Most bankers reported that residential mortgage demand remained weak, and some said higher borrowing costs had begun to dampen commercial lending.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Employment continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace for most Districts. Only one District reported a slight decline in employment, and one other reported no change in employment levels. While some Districts noted that labor availability had increased, firms continued to report difficulty in filling open positions. Many firms hesitated to lay off employees even as demand for their goods and services slowed and planned to reduce headcount through attrition if needed. With persistently tight labor markets, wage pressures remained elevated across Districts, though five Reserve Banks reported that these pressures had eased somewhat. Some employers noted they have continued to offer bonuses and enhanced benefits to attract and retain workers.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Selling prices increased at a modest or moderate pace in most Districts, though many said that the pace of increases had slowed from that of recent reporting periods. Manufacturers in many Districts reported continued easing in freight costs and prices for commodities, including steel and lumber, though some said input costs remained elevated. Many retailers noted increased difficulty in passing through cost increases, suggesting greater price sensitivity on the part of consumers. In addition, some retailers offered more discounts and promotions than they had a year ago in order to move merchandise and clear out excess inventories. On balance, contacts across Districts said they expected future price growth to moderate further in the year ahead.

The District's economy slowed slightly as 2022 drew to a close amid high interest rates and elevated costs and selling prices. However, the share of contacts reporting higher costs or selling prices declined noticeably from the middle of 2022. Looking ahead, firms expect softer conditions to persist in the near term but still plan to add workers to meet existing and expected demand for their goods and services.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Business activity in the First District was roughly flat on balance, with continued strength in tourism and further declines in home sales. Prices increased modestly, and many contacts reported that nonlabor cost pressures had eased considerably. Employment rose moderately, spurred by seasonal hiring in retail and hospitality. Wage pressures remained substantial. Some firms sought ways to boost productivity and profitability. Home sales fell sharply, and commercial leasing and investment activity were flat. Software and IT services firms enjoyed mostly strong and stable demand. Outside of real estate markets, where the outlook weakened slightly, most contacts remained optimistic for their own prospects, even though some deemed a recession as likely for 2023. No firms planned to make significant layoffs and most expected price increases to moderate moving forward.

Employment increased moderately on balance, spurred by a seasonal uptick in demand and easier hiring conditions. Wage growth proceeded at an above-average pace. A clothing retailer found it easier than expected to hire seasonal workers, especially positions involving remote work, but had to offer hiring bonuses to attract warehouse workers. Robust convention activity and holiday parties gave a moderate boost to food and beverage staffing at Boston-area hotels. In contrast, airline industry contacts found it very hard to fill positions and some restaurants cut hours in response to persistent staffing shortages. Firms in diverse sectors commented that wage growth was above average (if mostly stable) and that employment costs continued to eat into profit margins. Many contacts planned to focus increasingly on raising labor productivity and cutting costs. No firms planned to undertake significant staffing reductions, not even those that had experienced weak results recently.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Prices increased modestly on balance. Most contacts said that their output prices were flat since the previous report and that nonlabor cost pressures had retreated substantially. However, hotel room rates in the Greater Boston area increased sharply since the summer, in part for seasonal reasons, and landed well above their year-earlier levels. Cape Cod lodging prices posted a modest seasonal decline, but easily exceeded their comparable 2019 levels. A clothing retailer posted high single-digit markups earlier this fall but offered promotional discounts during the holiday shopping season. Retailers and manufacturers alike commented that nonlabor cost pressures had eased considerably in recent months, as the price of container shipments in particular fell sharply and supply chains improved. Prices at software and IT firms were up modestly on average, although one contact enacted "more aggressive" price increases in the second half of 2022. Moving forward, some contacts expected to hold prices firm or even to offer promotions to retain business, and others expected to face ongoing cost pressures—linked largely to employment—that could necessitate further price hikes. On balance, price increases were expected to moderate, however.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
First District retail contacts reported mixed sales, while tourism contacts saw strong increases in activity. A clothing retailer experienced softer demand throughout most of the fall, but sales rebounded during the holiday season, surpassing expectations for that period. Cape Cod retailers experienced strong fourth quarter sales, which a contact attributed to the fact that remote work arrangements have boosted the number of visitors to the Cape during the post-summer months. Accordingly, hospitality contacts on the Cape enjoyed a record-setting fourth quarter for occupancy and room rates. Airline passenger traffic through Boston increased steadily in recent months, reaching 93 percent of pre-pandemic levels, and cruise ship activity through Boston and into Maine accelerated during the same period. The Greater Boston hotel occupancy rate increased further, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Convention activity also increased sharply, and bookings into 2023 are in line to exceed 2019 levels. Three tourism contacts expressed concerns that inflation could crimp leisure spending in 2023, but none had seen any actual signs of a slowdown yet.

Recent results were mixed across First District manufacturing contacts. A toy manufacturer reported a sharp decline in revenues in the third quarter, citing inflation’s impact on lower-income consumers as one cause. A chemical manufac-turer faced weaker demand from clients in the construction and automobile industries, and as competitor firms sought to shed excess inventories. Two consumer goods manufacturers had flat and moderately stronger sales in December, respectively, after each had seen slumping sales earlier in the fall; recent sales beat seasonal expectations in both cases. A frozen food producer experienced steady demand despite the fact that it had posted three large price increases in the last 18 months. One contact made a significant down-ward revision to its capital spending plans, and others held plans steady. Most contacts were more optimistic for 2023 than they had been earlier in the year. The toy manufacturer, however, expected a recession in 2023 and accordingly weaker sales.

Demand was strong and stable in the fourth quarter among most contacts. However, one firm experienced a moderate decline in bookings that was not unexpected, and that was attributed to a weakening macroeconomic environment. Contacts reported year-over-year revenue increases that ranged from moderate to very large. Where recent demand was strong, contacts attributed their results to the post-pandemic rebound of client firms and to the essential nature of certain IT services. Two firms said that higher employee-related expenditures had pinched their profit margins somewhat. Capital and technology spending was flat or, in one case, experienced a modest decline that was attributed to the rise of cloud-based computing. Contacts expected to see steady or slightly softer demand in the near term, but cited a variety of downside risks to activity, such as a seasonal spike in respiratory illnesses, ongoing inflation, and stock market volatility. Nonetheless, contacts expressed a high degree of confidence in their firms' prospects for longer-term success.

## Category: Commercial Real Estate
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
The First District's commercial real estate market was relatively unchanged in recent weeks. The industrial market softened slightly, as rent growth slowed a bit, but vacancy rates remained very low. The office sector continued to experience high vacancy rates and flat rents. Conditions were stable in the retail property market, with food and beverage establishments experiencing the strongest demand. No significant acquisitions were reported for any property class, and new deals were said to be on hold until late in the first quarter of 2023. High interest rates continued to curtail borrowing activity, and refinancing occurred only out of absolute necessity. Concerning the outlook, contacts expected activity to be flat or to slow slightly on balance, but expectations differed by property type. While the industrial market was expected to continue to perform relatively well, the prospects for the office market weakened further, as some contacts feared that pending lease maturations would result in added vacancies. The outlook for the retail market was uncertain, as it was seen to depend heavily on the extent of any economic slowdown in 2023.

Home sales posted substantial further declines in November, and closed sales were down by 20 to 30 percent on a year-over-year basis. For single-family homes, re-cent results represented a sharp slowdown in sales from the previous report, whereas for condos the recent sales declines were slight-to-moderate. A Boston contact at-tributed weak demand for homes as a response to persistent inflation and higher mortgage rates. The same contact added that some would-be buyers have left the market entirely and that the buyers who remain are searching for homes at a more careful pace, as the bidding wars and waived inspections that characterized the market in re-cent years have become quite rare. Inventories remained down on an over-the-year basis in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Vermont, but by a much smaller margin than in the previous report. In other markets, inventory growth accelerated substantially from the previous report. Prices increased slightly over-the-year, at about the same pace as reported last time. Contacts expected home prices to continue to level off in the near term, and stressed that, despite cooling demand, further inventory growth was still needed in order to achieve a more balanced market.

Economic activity in the Second District declined significantly in the latest reporting period and most business contacts do not expect activity to increase in the coming months. Input prices continued to increase but have decelerated noticeably and selling price increases have moderated somewhat. Hiring has slowed, wage growth has remained modest, and businesses reported that they plan to add staff, on balance, in the months ahead. Manufacturing activity weakened substantially in the final weeks of 2022. Consumer spending was mixed but somewhat weaker overall, while tourism has remained strong. The home sales and rental markets showed further signs of cooling, though concerns about housing affordability remain widespread. Commercial real estate markets stabilized, and construction activity has remained sluggish. Conditions in the broad finance sector were generally steady, but regional banks reported widespread declines in loan demand, ongoing tightening in credit, and rising delinquency rates.

A large upstate New York employer noted that turnover has slowed noticeably in recent weeks and that attrition rates have now fallen below pre-pandemic levels. Still, there continues to be strong demand for skilled workers—particularly in IT, finance, and sales occupations. A New York City employment agency remarked that, despite recent layoff announcements, layoffs do not seem unusually high and job postings remain plentiful. Hiring plans for the first half of 2023 remained solid.

Consumer spending has been little changed in recent weeks. Nonauto retailers reported that business was relatively sluggish over the holiday season, with some of the weakness attributed to difficulties in procuring supplies and staff. Auto dealers in upstate New York reported that sales of new vehicles were steady to modestly higher, helped by improvement in the supply chain. However, sales of used vehicles have softened further. Consumer confidence across New York State surged to its highest level in more than three years in December.

Tourism activity in New York City strengthened further in December. Hotel occupancy rates climbed above 80 percent, versus 60 percent a year earlier, and average room tariffs were up roughly 20 percent over the year. Moreover, visits to major tourist attractions, such as the Statue of Liberty, have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. While attendance at Broadway shows has been mixed, high-profile musicals targeted towards visitors have reportedly fared quite well. Despite a dearth of visitors from Asia—especially China—the overall flow of international visitors has been fairly strong, though visitors are spending less, on average, due in part to the strong dollar.

Real estate contacts in upstate New York reported that prices have flattened out, and that sales volume and buyer traffic have continued to wane—in part attributed to unusually harsh winter weather. In and around New York City, sales of both single-family homes and apartments fell fairly sharply, while prices were flat to down modestly. Still, throughout the District, the inventory of available homes remains quite low, as many sellers have decided not to list.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
On balance, business activity in the Third District appears to have declined slightly after holding steady since the first of July. Inflation and higher interest rates have dampened consumer demand for big-ticket items, including homes and autos. Employment continued to grow slightly even as labor demand eased; business contacts noted an increased willingness to work. Wage growth and inflation continued to subside (and reported price increases were less widespread), but both continued at a moderate pace. Overall, firms continued to note less difficulty in hiring and fewer supply chain disruptions. On balance, expectations for economic growth over the next six months improved slightly among all firms; however, expectations remained well below their nonrecessionary historical averages.

Employment continued to grow slightly, with small net increases among nonmanufacturers outweighing small net decreases among manufacturers. Some firms reported that they will reduce their temporary staffing first as their own production slows. Staffing firms have also noted some softness in demand for temporary workers. Contacts, including staffing firms, also noted that hiring has become easier, with some suggesting that workers are beginning to feel the need to be employed full time.

Still, nearly all firms continued to describe staffing as their primary challenge. Many firms noted a high degree of job churn, which results in workers being hired into new industries for which they have no prior experience. Several contacts noted that some professional staff had left for higher salaries but then sought to return after experiencing their new firm's work environment.

Firms continued to report that wage growth had subsided but remained in a moderate range. Wage inflation remained pervasive. In our monthly surveys, the share of nonmanufacturing firms reporting higher wage and benefit costs per employee remained at a little over 40 percent, while just over half of the firms reported no change and a few reported lower compensation levels. Most contacts expect future wage growth to return to near pre-pandemic rates.

On balance, inflation continued to rise moderately, although reported increases were less widespread. Two-thirds of manufacturers reported no change in prices paid (for factor inputs) and almost two-thirds of nonmanufacturers reported no change in prices received (often from consumers). Moreover, the share of firms reporting increases less the share reporting decreases was at or below its nonrecessionary average for the difference between these two categories. Price increases were more commonly seen in the exchanges between firms for intermediate goods.

Manufacturing activity declined moderately – after having declined modestly in the prior period. The index for new orders fell further and was negative for the seventh consecutive month. In addition, the shipments index turned negative, suggesting that firms have begun to work through their backlogs. Many contacts confirmed that demand was slowing, backlogs are being fulfilled, and companies are reducing their inventories. One firm that reported strong sales indicated that it was gaining market share from failing competitors, not economic growth.

Market participants in commercial real estate continued to report steady current construction activity, although the pipeline is less full. Many contacts noted that higher interest rates, tighter credit, and current market uncertainty have delayed many deals, especially for land development. Demand remains strong for new space to serve industrial, warehousing, and the life sciences sector. Multifamily housing has begun to slow, and sentiment toward office space is turning increasingly dour. Leasing activity for office space has slowed modestly, and renewals are often seeking less space.

Business activity in the Fourth District slowed slightly since the previous report, though activity varied considerably by industry sector. District retailers indicated that sales over the holiday shopping season did not meet their growth expectations because inflation led households to spend more on necessities and less on discretionary items. Auto dealers, homebuilders, and residential realtors said that higher interest rates, along with persistent inventory shortages, constrained sales. Bankers reported that loan volumes declined further. By contrast, manufacturers said that demand increased slightly in recent months, particularly in goods categories with longer lead times. Looking forward, contacts are generally more pessimistic about the near-term outlook for demand. However, contacts' near-term hiring plans remained little changed, which suggest they will continue to hire. Upward wage pressures appeared to ease, as did the pressure on nonlabor input costs and selling prices.

Employment increased moderately in recent weeks despite slightly softer current business activity. Firms in manufacturing and professional and business services were most likely to report staff increases, while those in construction and freight were most likely to report staffing reductions. Reports of layoffs remained rare, and most contacts preferred to reduce employment through attrition when needed. One staffing services firm reported that demand had slowed noticeably in November and December, though the contact was "hoping" that it was a seasonal decline and would pick up in January. On balance, contacts expected to add more workers at a relatively steady pace in coming months.

Wage pressures eased over the past year, though they did not change meaningfully in recent weeks. There were a few new reports of increased worker availability, but most contacts suggested that labor markets remained very competitive, keeping wage pressures from easing further. While fewer firms raised pay compared to those that did a year previous, some offered their employees more generous yearend bonuses or accelerated the timeline for merit increases to help employees mitigate the impact of higher inflation.

Roughly half of contacts reported higher input costs recently compared to about three-quarters of them who reported the same this time last year. Manufacturers and nonresidential builders were most likely to report relief from rising input costs, often citing lower prices for steel, lumber, and freight. By contrast, costs were said to be rising for concrete, electronics, and electrical components. In many cases in which prices continued to rise, contacts pointed out that the rate of increase had declined noticeably. Looking forward, the share of firms expecting cost increases in the months ahead fell to 54 percent, its lowest since early 2021.

Some contacts noted that they were not increasing prices to remain competitive, while others said they were waiting to see if input costs increase further. However, weaker demand led homebuilders to use more incentives and discounts to close sales, while general merchandisers and apparel retailers used more promotions over the holiday shopping season to move goods and reduce inventories.

Reports from restauranteurs were mixed. While one fast food contact said her sales had increased as consumers "dined down" because of inflation, sit-down restaurants reported unchanged or decreased sales. Auto dealers continued to report flat or decreasing sales amid increased interest rates, higher vehicle prices, and limited inventory.

Demand for manufactured goods moved slightly higher in recent weeks. However, reports varied by industry segment. Demand increased for firms whose products have longer lead times, such as those producing parts used in commercial aircraft, and for manufacturers tied to the ongoing creation of new electric vehicle production capacity. By contrast, softer consumer spending led to a decline in orders for some firms as their customers rebalanced inventories. One packaging producer said that customer destocking had reduced demand for its cardboard-related products, leading to "historically high downtime" in production. While reports of supply chain disruptions were less frequent than in recent reporting periods, one HVAC producer said that her firm's sales had declined slightly because of customers' inability to secure necessary components. Manufacturers generally expected demand to change little in the coming months.

Overall, lending continued to decline during the reporting period, a situation which bankers attributed to higher interest rates that are increasing borrowing costs. Bankers noted moderate slowing in commercial lending, and some contacts reported weaker loan pipelines. On the household side, lenders said that residential and auto loan volumes continued to decline as higher interest rates and selling prices dampened activity. Bankers indicated that delinquency rates for commercial and consumer loans remained low. Core deposits declined, and some lenders attributed this decline to customers' seeking higher-yielding alternatives and to increased deposit rate competition among banks. Looking ahead, bankers expected that loan volumes would continue to decline through the first quarter because of a decrease in applications in the pipeline.

Nonprofit contacts suggested that job opportunities for lower-wage workers increased in recent months. Several noted that jobs in hospitality and retail were particularly plentiful, likely boosted by seasonal hiring. Contacts cited the largest barriers to lower-wage workers' participating in the labor force continued to be a lack of affordable childcare and transportation followed by flexible scheduling, wages, and whether those wages would make up for any loss of government benefits (the "benefits cliff"). Regarding affordable housing, a plurality of contacts was concerned about rising rents and the exhaustion of programs such as emergency rental assistance in 2022. Several contacts said these factors are likely to exacerbate a trend toward homelessness and overcrowding, and individuals might "double up" and move in with family or friends.

On balance, the Fifth District economy continued to expand slightly in recent weeks as consumer spending grew modestly but activity in other sectors declined. Manufacturing activity softened slightly, and new orders declined. District ports reported a moderate decline in activity, particularly for loaded import volumes. Trucking activity also slowed, partially due to a typical seasonal slowdown, and spot shipping rates decreased moderately. Overall, retail spending grew moderately as strong holiday sales helped lift revenues. Travel and tourism venues also reported moderate growth. Vehicle sales, however, remained low as higher interest rates deterred purchases. Residential real estate activity also softened due to elevated mortgage rates leading to lower sales volume with more seller concessions. Commercial real estate activity slowed moderately across all market segments and some commercial construction projects were cancelled or put on hold. Lending volumes reflected the pull back in borrowing demand and some banks reported increasing delinquency rates in their consumer portfolios. Nonfinancial services reported steady demand and revenues. Total employment increased only modestly with some employers noting being more cautious about hiring and others saying they couldn't raise wages any further. Overall, prices continued to grow strongly in recent weeks; however, some input prices eased.

Several contacts reported that retaining employees continued to be a major issue. One quick service restaurant stated that their company has great culture, but new hires don't stick around long enough to find out. Several contacts reported being at a breaking point on increasing wages as they cannot pass through costs anymore to consumers. Inflation has been a major drain on margins as firms raised wages multiple times to keep up with increased wage expectations for current and potential employees.

The volume of empty containers leaving the ports continued to be strong. Dwell time at the ports shortened leading to less congestion and lower storage fees. As shipping lines had some freed-up capacity, spot rates continued to decline back to pre-pandemic price levels and were significantly under current contract rates. Due in part to an earlier and longer Chinese New Year, the ports were anticipating significantly lower import volumes in the first quarter of 2023.

There was reduced market activity this period, partially due to usual seasonality, with a decline in the number of listings, decreased buyer traffic, and increased days on market. Respondents indicated that there were fewer closed and pending home sales as elevated mortgage rates and low housing inventory impacted volume. Sales prices have decreased modestly from their peak in the spring; however, sellers were offering more concessions to complete transactions. New home builders also were doing more discounting and/or providing incentives to sell their remaining housing inventory. New home construction costs were lower than their recent peak but still above pre-pandemic levels. There also was a significant pullback in investor activity in the single home market.

There was decreased demand for office and retail space particularly in central business districts. Property owners were offering bigger concessions rather than lowering asking rents on new leases for both multifamily and retail.

Nonfinancial service providers reported stable demand for their services as well as revenue growth. Contacts expected to moderately increase wages in the coming year to maintain and grow their workforces. One professional services firm was budgeting for technology upgrades to remain efficient during this time of workforce uncertainty. Supply chain issues were improving, but this improvement was being offset by a decrease in demand from clients. Inflation and rising interest rates were still a concern for firms' customers, which added uncertainty to making business decisions.

Sixth District economic activity grew at a gradual pace from mid-November through December. Labor market pressures eased somewhat, but wage pressures persisted. Most nonlabor cost increases moderated; however, food prices climbed, and freight costs remained elevated. Some firms' pricing power diminished. Holiday sales at District retailers were strong, and auto sales rose. Leisure travel activity was robust, and bookings for the first half of 2023 were strong. Housing inventory levels rose as home sales declined. Commercial real estate conditions weakened. Transportation activity continued to decline. Manufacturing demand remained steady. Deposit growth at financial institutions slowed, but loan growth was steady. Energy production remained strong, but winter weather caused storm-related outages and damage to powerlines. Agricultural conditions were mixed.

Labor market pressures eased further since the previous report, but firms continued to describe labor markets as tight. Several contacts noted that entry-level roles were easier to fill; hiring for skilled positions remained challenging. Staffing was still a top concern and firms were largely intent on keeping talent even if demand slows; most indicated that they would strongly resist layoffs and would instead right size via attrition. Several employers required employees to return to the office and have become less flexible with remote work arrangements.

Sixth District contacts noted most nonlabor input cost increases moderated over the reporting period, though price levels remained historically elevated. While domestic freight cost increases persisted, largely due to higher energy and labor costs, shipping container rates returned to near-"normal" pricing. Food prices rose significantly. Many firms described diminished pricing power due to elevated inventories and/or increased price sensitivity from customers. The Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations survey showed year-over-year unit cost growth decreased in December to 3.8 percent, on average, down from 4 percent in November. Firms' year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased from 3.3 percent in November to 3.1 percent in December, on average.

Despite more moderate price growth and a recent drop in mortgage interest rates, housing demand in the Sixth District continued to deteriorate. Sales fell sharply across the region and inventory levels rose. Most homes sold for below the asking price and the number of days on market reached near pre-pandemic levels. Builders continued to reduce new home construction in response to declining demand. According to builder contacts, demand in the entry-level and second home markets was the weakest and cancellation rates remained high. A significant share of builders cut prices and increased incentives to attract buyers.

Commercial real estate (CRE) contacts reported weakening market conditions in lower-tier office, luxury multifamily and owner-operator retail segments. The industrial sector was robust; however, contacts voiced concerns over future activity levels. The downward trend in the office sector has eased some as more employers require their staff to return to the office; however, heightened levels of sublease space remained an impediment to market recovery. A greater number of contacts shared concerns over declining CRE values as the bid-ask spread remained wide. More instances were noted of slowing or negative net operating income and rent growth. Contacts continued to report occurrences of declining asset prices and buyers seeking greater concessions.

Transportation activity continued to slow from unsustainable pandemic levels. While some southeastern ports reported that breakbulk cargo volumes rose as shippers sought alternative ways to move cargo amid supply chain disruptions, container traffic decreased and was characterized as a return to more sustainable growth. Trucking tonnage also fell, and housing-related freight was noted as particularly weak. Railroads experienced declines in intermodal shipments of packaging materials, chemicals, and metals. Logistics firms involved in moving and relocation, "big and bulky" delivery services, and warehousing saw year-over-year volume declines as consumer and housing demand softened and firms reduced inventory levels. Most transportation contacts expect additional weakening of demand in 2023.

Weaker spending categories included furniture and toys. Retailers increased promotions prior to Christmas and boosted them further after Christmas to sell off excess inventories. New vehicle sales were little changed, and dealers were concerned that rising inventories and financing rates would hurt profitability. Used vehicle sales decreased slightly, and prices continued their fall from peak levels earlier in 2022. Overall, leisure and hospitality spending was up a bit, while some airlines and cruise lines noted that the level of spending was well above last year's. Movie ticket sales were also up.

With rivers rising, barge shipments returned closer to normal levels, easing shipping costs some. Furthermore, prices for inputs such as fertilizers, chemicals, and energy all moved down during the reporting period, and there was less concern about the availability of inputs. However, some contacts expressed worries about higher interest rates on farm loans. Soybean prices were higher, whereas corn prices were little changed. Egg and cattle prices continued moving up, while dairy and hog prices generally continued to move down. Most major agricultural prices ended 2022 higher than they were at the end of 2021.

Small business support organizations said clients continued to face margin pressures due to rising input costs, leading to increased loan delinquencies. In addition, higher interest rates were making small businesses reluctant to take on working capital loans. Nonprofit organizations said that uncertainty about the employment outlook was complicating low- and moderate-income households' long-term financial decisions, such as whether to pursue homeownership. Philanthropic organizations continued to face the challenge of balancing increased requests to address basic needs—such as food insecurity—with lower revenues.

Additionally, some manufacturing contacts reported lower nonlabor input costs, stemming from increased inventory availability. A contact in the auto industry reported lower prices for used and new vehicles as inventories grow. Multiple contacts cited higher interest rates as a driver for weaker demand, which in turn caused them to maintain or lower their prices. For businesses that reported increasing prices, the rate at which they were able to do so varied widely, with some contacts passing on only 5 percent of their costs increases and others passing on 75 percent. A contact in the home building industry cited labor costs as placing upward pressure on prices.

Auto dealers in Little Rock noted that inventories remain too low to meet demand at current prices, especially in used cars, and that they had a surprising surge in foot traffic shortly after Thanksgiving. The winter storm at the end of December forced restaurants in Memphis to close fully or partially, which negatively affected sales on one of the busiest days of the year. St. Louis hospitality contacts noted that business activity was lower in December compared with November, although banquet business exceeded expectations. Hospitality contacts have lower expectations for the upcoming months due to the increase in sicknesses, higher-than-average inflation, and staff shortages.

Commercial and industrial loan growth increased slightly, while consumer loan growth decreased moderately. Commercial real estate loans, however, still showed moderate growth compared with our previous report. Total deposits growth decreased moderately, but a Memphis contact noted that deposit rate competition has picked up among banks. Credit quality remains strong despite interest rate hikes, and the number of past-due loans is still low.

Employment grew modestly since the last report, with most District states seeing increasing payrolls. A December survey found that 44 percent of hospitality and tourism firms in Minnesota reported that they were hiring in some capacity, with more than half looking to increase year-round head count; 14 percent cut seasonal staff, but almost no one cut year-round staff. However, other smaller surveys of businesses across the District showed softer hiring sentiment in both November and December, and future hiring expectations were similarly flat. Job postings and other signs of hiring demand also continued to soften somewhat but remained healthy overall. Contacts reported small improvements in labor availability, but continued difficulty in hiring. Many businesses continued to adapt as a result. Said one contact, "Retail and manufacturing are getting good at operating with less than a full crew."

Wage pressures fell slightly but remained at high levels. Firms reported minor softening in the pace of wage growth, more so for salaried than hourly workers. But overall pressure was still well above average. Nearly half of hospitality and tourism firms reported wage increases of 5 percent or more, but future wage expectations were notably lower. A Minnesota contact said that more employers were offering sign-up or retention bonuses rather than higher wages.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Prices increased modestly overall since the previous report. Two-thirds of respondents to a District business conditions poll reported no change to the prices they charged for their products and services in December from a month earlier; about half of firms said their nonlabor input prices were unchanged. The wholesale prices component of a regional manufacturing index decreased to a level just above neutral in December, its lowest reading since the early months of the pandemic. A producer of home furnishing products noted that raw materials prices have come down less than 10 percent, but "we have had to reduce pricing by around 20 percent to get additional business." Despite reductions in many construction materials costs, a road construction contractor expected a 13 percent increase in concrete prices in 2023. Retail fuel prices in District states declined rapidly since the last report. Prices received by farmers in November increased from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, sugar beets, potatoes, hay, hogs, cattle, turkeys, chickens, and eggs; prices for chickpeas and canola decreased from a year ago.

Low-wage workers in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area reported continued pressures from higher food prices. Some said they found it increasingly difficult to pay their bills and were therefore accumulating credit card debt. A Minnesota labor contact said that the number of traveling nurses had declined but remained high. Many nursing program graduates were reportedly rethinking their choice to pursue a career in health care, as shortages have resulted in higher stress for existing workers. A workforce development contact reported that some former housekeepers had decided to start their own businesses rather than getting paid $5 per cleaned room by a hotel chain. Other workers were said to have left their jobs to start businesses in food, landscaping, and snow removal.

Consumer spending grew modestly since the last report, remaining at high levels. Retailers overall reported a decent holiday shopping season, with good initial traffic interrupted by severe winter weather. A South Dakota contact said that the shopping season started strong but ended "somewhat weaker than many businesses anticipated" because of poor weather that impacted not only customer traffic but also product inventories. A Minnesota mall reported December foot traffic was up over last year despite weather events, and anecdotal evidence indicated that shoppers spent more. Another mall contact reported that sales were up 8 percent over last year and that new leasing activity was encouraging. A suburban Minnesota mall estimated that sales rose by 5 to 10 percent, with high traffic volumes even during the week. "Restaurants continue to knock it out of the park, with waiting periods from the time they open." A vehicle dealership with multiple locations saw sales of both new and used vehicles rise in December, year over year.

Commercial construction fell slightly since the last report. Industry data suggested that revenue levels across the sector have not declined significantly. But firms reported slowing activity and that high project costs were propping up revenues. A contact in southeast Minnesota said that companies and their clients were "choosing between delaying projects at normal prices or getting done on time at inflated prices." Sources also suggested that the pipeline of new projects out for bid was shrinking, though industrial and multifamily construction was still healthy. Single-family residential construction continued to decline. December permitting activity was much lower than a year ago in most of the District's larger markets. For example, single-family permits in the Minneapolis–St. Paul region in December were less than half their levels from a year earlier.

Commercial real estate was flat since the last report. Vacancy rates remained favorable in multifamily and industrial sectors even with new construction, but unfavorable in office space despite little new construction. Property sales were subdued due to higher interest rates and economic uncertainty. Residential real estate continued to decline for similar reasons. Closed sales in November and December were widely lower compared with last year. In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, December sales dropped by 48 percent year over year. In some markets, new listings declined as sellers waited for better market conditions, yet inventories of homes for sale increased with the large drop in sales.

District manufacturing activity decreased slightly since the last report. Results from the Minneapolis Fed's annual survey of manufacturers indicated that firms overall saw increased orders, production, capital expenditures, and employment in 2022, with stable expectations for their firms in the year ahead. However, a regional index of manufacturing conditions indicated a mild contraction in activity in Minnesota and North Dakota in December from a month earlier, while activity expanded in South Dakota. Manufacturing contacts generally reported no change or a slight decrease in new orders. However, a producer of homebuilding inputs reported a drastic decline in new orders, and a custom manufacturer in Minnesota reported they have canceled all capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2023.

Activity among minority- and women-owned businesses slowed slightly in recent weeks according to reports from contacts. Input and labor costs were reportedly diminishing profits for many. A small steel manufacturer reported success in doubling their workforce after offering health insurance for the first time, a move they made at the expense of profitability. Contractors reported that uncertainty due to ongoing material shortages and price increases was making it difficult to meet existing bids. "We never know what we'll end up paying for materials," shared a Minnesota contact. "Bids do not move with those changes and we cannot walk away." Food service businesses were said to be losing the hiring race to restaurant chains and other more established businesses.

## Category: Summary of Economic Activity
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Economic activity in the Tenth District continued to decline slightly through the end of 2022. Hiring activity slowed further, but the labor market remained very tight. Several segments of the service sector had modest declines in employment, but job openings remained elevated. Given the ongoing tightness in the labor market, wage pressures remained high overall, and businesses noted that wage growth still has momentum. Manufacturing activity continued to decline at a modest pace, but expectations firmed somewhat. Consumer spending declined recently, particularly at retailers and restaurants. Given the amount of leisure travel, contacts noted that retail spending was lower than expected. Additionally, retailers indicated they are dealing with a glut of inventories resulting from loosening supply bottlenecks. Those previously delayed retail goods now in inventories are reportedly not well aligned with current consumer demand, and so are being sold at steep discounts. Cost pressures for service businesses remained elevated, but the pass through to customers became more difficult recently. Across goods and services, price growth slowed to a moderate, yet still-brisk, pace. Growth in overall energy activity slowed across the District, as falling oil and gas prices were a headwind to new drilling and production.

Hiring continued to slow in the Tenth District as labor demand cooled, though the number of job openings and overall tightness of the labor market remained high. Employment remained mostly unchanged for manufacturing businesses, while employers in the service sector reduced their payrolls slightly. Reductions in employment were broad-based across service sectors but varied in scale across segments. Many restaurants and retail businesses reported modest declines in jobs, while a small number of technology and financial service businesses reported more substantial job losses. More contacts reported they reduced hours worked by employees in recent weeks, another indication of cooling labor demand.

While hiring slowed, wages grew moderately. District contacts broadly indicated that wage growth continues to have momentum due to ongoing imbalances in the labor market. In particular, wage growth in the lodging sector, where employment shortfalls remain pronounced, increased robustly. Most contacts reported they expect wages to increase at either the same rate, or a pace that is slightly faster, than wage growth over the past year.

Conversely, businesses in the services sector indicated input price growth remains elevated, and less than 20 percent of cost growth is passed to consumers. Service businesses noted they are struggling to strike a balance between retaining customers and maintaining profitability. Most contacts report that their expectations for future price growth are moderating compared to last year but remain elevated above historical norms.

Consumer spending fell moderately over the past month, despite robust leisure travel activity. Restauranteurs and retailers reported that "travelers just aren't spending like they used to." The lower propensity for travelers to dine out or shop, combined with adverse weather events and waning demand more broadly, led contacts to report a softer-than-expected beginning of the winter season. Travel and accommodation spending was elevated, driven by higher prices rather than higher volumes, as total occupancy remained subdued.

Many non-profit organizations reported expanding their capacity recently in response to higher levels of household financial stress and food insecurity over the past year. One food bank in Kansas City reported that the number of sack lunches they provided tripled in 2022, with similar reports of heightened demand in other District cities. However, food bank contacts noted the increases in food and fuel costs earlier in the year coincided with declining donations, which depleted financial reserves and inhibited their ability to provide services in recent months. Difficulty meeting an increased demand for services was broad-based in the non-profit sector, with many organizations also citing difficulty recruiting volunteers and the health of their employees as major challenges to their operations.

Subleasing activity in commercial real estate increased rapidly in recent weeks. Commercial space previously occupied by tech sector businesses became increasingly available. Contacts reported they expect further acceleration in the amount of office space that will be offered on secondary markets in coming months. Accordingly, prices of subleased space dropped, and terms became more favorable for incoming tenants. In residential real estate, builders of new single-family homes noted an uptick in the number of buyer cancellations for projects underway. In recent weeks, those cancelled purchases were backfilled by secondary buyers seeking homes. However, contacts indicated they expect "a bigger cliff of cancellations will hit builders in the spring."

Loan demand remained stable in the past month, except for residential mortgages, which continued to decline swiftly. Bankers experienced steady interest from borrowers across the Commercial and Industrial and Commercial Real Estate segments of their loan portfolios, despite higher interest rates on new originations. Although credit quality remained stable in recent weeks, contacts expected deterioration in the next six months as higher interest rates impair property valuations and borrowers' ability to generate sufficient cash flow for debt service, particularly in the CRE space. Deposits declined moderately this month as competitive rate pressures and inflationary dynamics eroded deposit balances. Nonbank financial institutions and firms with reduced liquidity drove deposit rates higher over the month.

Growth in overall energy activity slowed modestly in the Tenth District, as falling oil and gas prices were a headwind to new drilling and production. Contacts in the service segments of the sector reported little change in business activity. Despite several notable developments during the past month – in particular, G7 price caps and European sanctions on Russian oil exports and production cuts by OPEC – the overwhelming majority of contacts reported no changes to their production plans resulting from these events thus far. Looking ahead to later this year, most businesses indicated they expect oil and gas production to increase by less than 5 percent, as they expected prices to be slightly below levels necessary for more significant production increases. Several contacts also noted that ongoing delays in industry supply chains are expected to constrain production growth in 2023.

Contacts reported strong competition for labor and difficulties attracting experienced talent in health care, legal services, manufacturing, and skilled trades. Several real estate firms and mortgage providers reported reducing the number of open positions in response to moderating demand and noted that recent hiring freezes and layoffs in the technology sector improved the size and quality of the applicant pool. Contacts in Alaska and Hawaii continued to report challenges filling entry-level positions, partly due to elevated shelter costs.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from December 01,2022 to January 8, 2023.
Prices rose at a slower pace relative to the previous reporting period, but overall price levels remained very elevated. Contacts cited wage pressures as the primary driver of the price inflation they have experienced in recent weeks. Several contacts, particularly in manufacturing and construction, reported plans to pass through last year's cost increases to their customers when annual contracts are renegotiated. Several sectors reported higher prices, including health care, food services, hospitality, insurance, and air travel. Conversely, gradually improving supply chains and cooling overall demand have resulted in stable or lower prices for many goods, including energy products, medical equipment, electronics, office supplies, and manufacturing inputs such as steel and lumber.

Communities across the District continued to highlight key issues such as high inflation, lack of affordable housing, and lower enrollment rates at community colleges and higher education institutions. Reports indicated people are working "side hustles" or multiple jobs to afford the elevated living costs, and concerns of evictions have increased of late as rent inflation further strained household budgets. Donation-dependent nonprofit and philanthropic organizations noted that tighter financial markets have resulted in significant drops in fundraising inflows. This reduction was partially offset by government funding in some areas, including parts of California and Nevada. Contacts also highlighted that the recent uptick in respiratory infections, including influenza, intensified worker and volunteer shortages at many community and social support organizations.

Activity in the manufacturing sector was mixed over the reporting period. Demand strengthened for capital equipment and manufactured intermediate goods in the packaging, logistics, and aviation industries. Conversely, demand for manufactured metal products, renewable energy equipment, and intermediate construction goods softened, partially due to slower activity in the residential real estate market. Capacity utilization in food manufacturing improved, although labor shortages continued to constrain production. Manufacturers reported that disruptions in labor markets and supply chains had eased but input costs remained elevated. Contacts in Utah highlighted strong overall conditions for local manufacturers, noting increased business migration to the state.

Conditions in the agriculture and resource-related sectors remained generally weak. Overall domestic agricultural sales were up in terms of dollars but down in volume. Sales abroad varied by export market, with demand from Asian and European markets declining or remaining unchanged, while demand from the Middle East increased significantly. Global economic uncertainty and a generally strong dollar continued to put downward pressure on international demand. Adverse weather conditions negatively impacted agricultural yields across the District, including for cherries, grapes, and nuts. Seafood production was also down, partially due to closures of crab fisheries in Alaska. Contacts noted that supply chain bottlenecks ameliorated further, but transportation and materials costs remained elevated. One producer in the Pacific Northwest noted that demand for timberland remained high, partially due to growing private interest in opportunities for carbon offset investment.

Residential real estate activity weakened further in recent weeks. Demand for new and existing single-family housing fell modestly across the District, primarily driven by high prices and mortgage costs. Contacts reported that selling prices began to come down and rental rates were stable on balance. Construction of single-family housing dropped moderately as existing projects reached completion and starts fell modestly. Construction activity for multifamily housing varied across the District as activity was solid in Northern California and Washington but down in Oregon. Contacts noted some construction materials prices, such as wallboard, fell substantially, while other materials prices remained stable but high.

Conversely, residential and business lending activity slowed further, reflecting high interest rates and rising economic uncertainty. Competition for deposits tightened as deposit growth slowed, with one credit union financier mentioning the need to borrow funds to match loan demand. Credit quality remained strong, but bankers observed some general deterioration of late. Some business contacts reported pausing large borrowing and investment plans given the current economic uncertainty.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from January 9, 2023 to February 26, 2023.
Overall economic activity increased slightly in early 2023. Six Districts reported little or no change in economic activity since the last report, while six indicated economic activity expanded at a modest pace. On balance, supply chain disruptions continued to ease. Consumer spending generally held steady, though a few Districts reported moderate to strong growth in retail sales during what is typically a slow period. Auto sales were little changed, on balance, though inventory levels continued to improve. Several Districts indicated that high inflation and higher interest rates continued to reduce consumers' discretionary income and purchasing power, and some concern was expressed about rising credit card debt. Travel and tourism activity remained fairly strong in most Districts. Manufacturing activity stabilized following a period of contraction. While housing markets remained subdued, restrained by exceptionally low inventory, an unexpected uptick in activity beyond the seasonal norm was seen in some Districts along the eastern seaboard. Commercial real estate activity was steady, with some growth in the industrial market but ongoing weakness in the office market. Demand for nonfinancial services was steady overall but picked up in a few Districts. On balance, loan demand declined, credit standards tightened, and delinquency rates edged up. Energy activity was flat to down slightly, and agricultural conditions were mixed. Amid heightened uncertainty, contacts did not expect economic conditions to improve much in the months ahead.

Some Districts noted that firms were finding it more difficult to pass on cost increases to their consumers. Selling prices increased moderately in most Districts, with several Districts noting a deceleration. Home prices were generally flat or down slightly, while rents were reported to be steady or higher. Still, home prices and rents remained high, contributing to ongoing concerns about housing affordability. Looking ahead, contacts expected price increases to continue to moderate over the year.

The District's economy contracted slightly early in 2023, in large part because higher interest rates and prices continued to weigh on household spending. Contacts in other sectors, including freight and manufacturing, often cited the weakness in household spending as contributing to softer demand in their own industries. Firms added workers at a slower pace as many expected softer business conditions to persist in the months ahead.

Business activity in the First District increased slightly on average amid modest growth in retail and restaurant activity. Manufacturers reported a slightly slower pace of activity, especially for semiconductor sales, but remained upbeat. Residential real estate sales fell modestly, while commercial real estate markets were stable but the outlook weakened. Employment was flat as wage growth remained above average and labor shortages persisted for many positions. No contacts planned to enact significant layoffs in the near term, even if recent sales had slowed. Some firms expected to offer above-average wage increases in 2023 to stave off still-high attrition rates, while others were planning for average wage growth. Prices increased slightly overall, as a variety of nonlabor costs continued to ease. Contacts expected to enact at least modest further price increases in 2023.

Wage growth was steady at an above-average pace, and headcounts were roughly flat on balance. Retailers reported a modest decline in headcounts on average, with significant layoffs at one firm and elevated attrition at others, while restaurant employment rose slightly since the last report but remained somewhat below its pre-pandemic benchmark. One manufacturer noted strong hiring, while other manufacturing contacts reported flat or slightly lower headcounts. Retailers said that wage pressures remained strong (if stable) in the face of elevated attrition, and manufacturers said that hiring remained a challenge or got slightly easier. A workforce development contact faced difficulties keeping candidates engaged in their degree and placement programs (for technical roles) despite abundant job openings; the contact noted that high childcare costs deterred some candidates but that other cases of disinterest were harder to explain. According to staffing services contacts, welders, carpenters, and mechanics were highly sought after by construction employers and remained very hard to find. Wage growth for construction workers remained well above average. Light industrial roles were also hard to fill despite employers' having enacted large hourly wage increases for such positions in recent years. Some firms hesitated to make direct hires given fears of a recession, but hiring from temporary roles became more common. Labor market power was seen as shifting slightly more in favor of employers, as employees lost some leverage in demanding hybrid work and flexible schedules. Contacts in the semiconductor industry said that they had no plans to lay off workers despite slowing sales, although one paused plans to expand headcounts. Otherwise, hiring plans among manufacturers were unchanged, and retail headcounts were expected to hold steady moving forward. The outlook for wage growth was mixed, as staffing contacts expected the pace of wage growth to soften, while retailers expected to have to raise wages (and other compensation) at an above-average pace in 2023 to stave off attrition, and manufacturers planned for average merit increases despite some larger gains in starting pay for hard-to-fill positions.

Prices were up slightly on average, as nonlabor pricing pressures continued to abate but with some noteworthy exceptions. Retail and restaurant contacts reported further declines in freight and shipping costs. Nonetheless, restaurants faced new pressure on profit margins from rising rents and rising health insurance costs, in addition to still-elevated (if relatively stable) food prices and credit card processing fees. One retailer posted moderate price increases to pass on increased propane and labor costs, as other retailers held prices steady. Manufacturing contacts said that nonlabor cost pressures had moderated recently. Lumber costs stabilized, but overall construction costs remained elevated due to lingering supply chain issues and scarce labor. Although none had significantly changed their output prices since the last report, manufacturers perceived that further price increases were likely for 2023.

Among First District contacts, retail and restaurant sales increased modestly in recent weeks. An online retailer experienced a slight uptick in sales volume relative to seasonal expectations following the holidays. A salvage store similarly enjoyed a small increase in sales, which the contact attributed to a strong inventory of high-quality goods and the recovery of cross-border commerce with Canada to above pre-pandemic levels. A Massachusetts restaurant industry contact said that sales increased modestly throughout the state, contrary to typical seasonal dips after the holidays, although business at downtown Boston establishments continued to substantially trail pre-pandemic levels. Despite growth in sales volume, profits were hurt by increases in ancillary costs. A discount furniture retailer experienced minor improvements in sales volume so far this year, noting that new product lines at lower price points were a particular source of strength. Contacts were optimistic on balance, but several pointed to an increased focus on cost containment strategies to maintain profits and minimize the need for further price increases.

News from our manufacturing contacts was largely positive. Contacts reported generally high levels of economic activity, but sales growth slowed to a modest pace on average. Reports from the cost side showed a similar pattern: prices and wages remained high, but price and wage inflation moderated significantly compared with 2022, and supply chain issues improved. Contacts in the semiconductor industry said that the boom of the last few years has cooled. Although booms and busts are typical in that industry, our contacts expected this bust cycle to be mild and possibly short-lived (less than one year). A furniture maker, who had recently been somewhat pessimistic about the direction of consumer spending, became more optimistic after their sales responded very positively to recent promotions. Otherwise, contacts were generally optimistic about 2023, expecting growth to revert to sustainable levels after a period of exceptional performance.

The commercial real estate market in the First District has been relatively stable since the beginning of 2023. The industrial market continued to see low vacancy rates and high leasing demand, but nonetheless rents have levelled off recently. Though the office market remained weak—a Hartford contact described the market as "abysmal"—another contact noted a slight increase in leasing interest for larger spaces in downtown Boston, and leasing was stable in Providence. In the retail market, food and beverage establishments experienced relatively strong leasing demand, while vacancies continued to pile up for department stores and big-box retail. Credit conditions tightened further, for example, as construction loans faced increased capital requirements. The only significant construction activity pertained to industrial properties. Most contacts expected commercial real estate activity to weaken moving forward, with the industrial market outperforming other sectors. The office class was predicted to weaken further, mainly as the result of pending lease maturations and the likelihood of high-profile loan defaults, and downward pressure on rents was expected.

In First District residential real estate markets, weak sales activity persisted even as inventory continued to improve in recent months. Boston and Vermont reported year-over-year changes for December 2022 while all other areas reported year-over-year changes for January 2023. Connecticut data were unavailable. Closed sales fell modestly in most markets since the last report and were down 30 percent from a year earlier, although sales of Maine condos improved slightly and were off by just 4 percent year-over-year. Inventories increased substantially in Rhode Island from the previous report and were stable elsewhere. Price growth slowed slightly from the previous report on balance, as median sales prices increased modestly over the year in most markets and were flat in Massachusetts (for single-family homes) and down slightly in Boston (for both single-family and condos). The Boston, Rhode Island, and Maine contacts attributed the slow sales activity to higher mortgage rates. That same set of contacts continued to express concerns about low inventories, stressing that even with recent increases in supply, the market remains unbalanced.

Labor market conditions have remained strong. On balance, employment increased slightly in recent weeks, with the strongest gains reported by businesses in the information and wholesale trade sectors. However, manufacturers indicated that employment declined for the first time since early in the pandemic. Still, job openings remained widespread and contacts at two major employment agencies indicated that concerns about a broader weakening in the labor market have not materialized. While it has become easier to attract and retain workers, finding workers with desired skills or experience remains a significant challenge. A New York City employment agency attributed some of the recent churn in the labor market to more workers looking for full or hybrid remote work options as many businesses have started to require more time onsite from their employees. Overall, hiring plans generally remain solid.

Tourism activity in New York City strengthened further in early 2023. Demand for hotel rooms continued to trend up, with hotel occupancy rates now just slightly below and average room rates modestly above pre-pandemic levels despite new hotels opening in the city. Attendance at Broadway shows has continued to improve, and a substantial number of shows are scheduled to open. Though business travel has yet to bounce back, domestic leisure travel has been strong, buoyed by the ability to work remotely. International travel continues to improve but has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The residential sales market remained subdued in early 2023, though there are signs that activity has begun to pick up beyond the seasonal norm. Real estate contacts in upstate New York reported that prices have been flat to down slightly, and that sales volume and buyer traffic remain sluggish. By contrast, sales of both single-family homes and apartments picked up in and around New York City, and prices held steady. The inventory of available homes has declined in Manhattan and has remained exceptionally low elsewhere. Bidding wars are still occurring for desirable properties in upstate New York and remain fairly widespread in and around New York City outside of Manhattan.

Community leaders highlighted the pressures faced by many households from a lack of availability of childcare and preschool. Such services are operating at a reduced capacity because of teacher shortages, the decline in childcare centers, and the expiration of pandemic-era funding. Housing affordability remains a significant challenge, despite efforts to improve affordability through changes in zoning and regional collaborations to build more housing. A rise in homelessness and large influx of asylum seekers have increased demands on the region's shelter and transitional housing sector.

On balance, business activity in the Third District appears to have increased slightly after declining slightly last period. Consumer demand appeared to tick up, but contacts cautioned against comparisons with year-ago sales that were dampened by the Omicron wave. Moreover, bankers and nonprofit agencies warned that lower-income households were buying food and other necessities on credit. Employment resumed a modest pace of growth despite the tight labor market. Wage growth and inflation continued to subside, but both remained moderate. Overall, firms continued to report less difficulty in hiring and fewer supply chain disruptions. On balance, expectations for economic growth over the next six months improved slightly among all firms; however, expectations remained well below their nonrecessionary historical averages.

The Fourth District economy contracted slightly in recent weeks amid persistent softness in household spending, particularly goods spending. Several retailers and restauranteurs reported a typical post-holiday sales slump, but some said that sales fell short of their expectations as inflation continued to weigh on discretionary spending. In addition, higher interest rates contributed to ongoing weakness in light vehicle and home sales. Freight and manufacturing firms suggested that softer household spending dampened demand in their own industries, while bankers noted that higher interest rates curbed overall loan demand. Contacts generally expected business activity to soften further in coming months. Employment rose slightly, and while reports of layoffs remained few, a larger share of contacts noted that they had paused hiring. Increased labor availability, particularly among lower-paid workers, was accompanied by some further relief in wage pressures. Nonlabor input cost pressures changed little in recent weeks, while selling price pressures edged higher.

Firms that were hiring often cited ongoing turnover and persistently high job vacancies as the main drivers. For instance, one manufacturer stated, "We still need about 10 percent [more] staff … to reach pre-COVID levels." On balance, contacts' hiring expectations suggest employment growth will slow further in coming weeks. Looking forward, several contacts suggested that they were less likely to lay off workers in the event of an economic downturn because they were focused on retaining enough staff to meet longer term production goals.

Notably, food and hospitality firms reported declining wage pressures related to increased labor availability. Meanwhile, contacts in the financial services and nonresidential construction sectors reported that sustained competition for skilled workers was still leading to large pay increases. Similarly, manufacturing contacts often offered wage increases that exceeded prepandemic norms to help employees offset the effects of inflation.

One general merchandiser noted that slower than normal holiday sales had been followed by further declines to start the new year, while another reported that high prices had led to a "pretty dramatic bias toward food and consumables over discretionary purchases. If there's money left over, customers will spend some on general merchandise." Auto dealers continued to report that higher vehicle prices and increased interest rates had resulted in softer customer demand. One industry contact said that his returning lease customers were often "shocked by the increase in monthly payments." On balance, contacts expected consumer spending to remain soft in coming months.

By contrast, softer demand was reported by firms associated with interest rate-sensitive sectors, including residential real estate and light vehicles. Multiple contacts said that softer consumer spending had reduced demand for their customers' products. Broadly, manufacturers expected demand for their products to remain steady or increase slightly in the coming months and they frequently cited improved supply chains and stabilizing inventories as contributing to their relatively optimistic expectations.

Some lenders also suggested that perceived economic uncertainty was causing borrowers to be more cautious. Overall, delinquency rates have remained low, though a few bankers noted a slight increase in credit card delinquencies. Core deposits continued to decrease slightly, and bankers suggested that deposit rate competition and a shift to higher-yield alternatives contributed to the decline. Looking ahead, lenders anticipated that loan demand would weaken further as borrowing costs are expected to remain elevated.

Contacts noted that individuals were more likely to seek their services for training opportunities than for job placement. One contact mentioned that every worker who recently completed a manufacturing training program had at least two job offers. The difficulty manufacturers are having attracting and retaining workers led some to explore apprenticeships to meet their staffing needs. According to multiple contacts, lower-wage workers have greater options for employment and have become more selective in their job choices, prioritizing flexible work schedules in addition to pay. An eastern Kentucky contact reported increased demand for skilled trade workers as the region continued to rebuild from the July 2022 floods.

The Fifth District economy grew modestly since our previous report. Manufacturing activity was unchanged, on balance, as some segments continued to grow while others contracted. District ports reported a net decline in total volumes as import activity slowed while loaded exports picked up moderately. Trucking companies also saw a decline in total volumes leading to lower spot market rates. Retailers experienced solid growth in sales and most said that consumer confidence was strong. Travel and tourism grew moderately, and hotels reported strong growth in revenues as occupancy was solid and average room rates were up. Residential real estate activity picked up in recent weeks, but the low inventory of houses continued to restrict sales volumes.

Year-over-year price growth remained elevated, however the pace of growth eased slightly in recent months. According to our most recent surveys, prices received by manufacturers grew around six percent over the prior year, but that was down from around ten percent growth reported in November 2022. Prices received by services firms, on the other hand, remained elevated and have yet to ease significantly from their recent peak. These trends largely reflected price growth for firms' inputs, with manufacturers seeing input price growth slowing more than services firms reported.

Manufacturing activity in the Fifth District was little changed in recent weeks. Sentiment about business conditions reflected the industries manufacturers serve. For instance, a steel manufacturer reported a "siloing" of demand, as growing industries – like electric vehicle plants – was making-up for declining parts of their business, like shopping centers. On balance, supply chains continued to improve as order backlogs and vendor lead times declined. Hiring was growing at a slower pace than previous periods. A cabinet manufacturer was forgoing layoffs amid expected declines in new orders, allowing attrition to naturally happen without replacing departing workers.

Most residential real estate professionals and builders noted a surprising uptick in new home sales activity since the beginning of the year. Housing inventory increased moderately, nevertheless it had a long way to go to reach market equilibrium. One respondent indicated that buyers were out looking again but it would be a better scenario if there were more homes available for sale. The low housing inventory also has resulted in fewer closed and pending home sales this period. Sales prices decreased modestly from their peak last spring; however, terms were more beneficial to the buyers. Lumber prices were down but overall construction costs remained high; the average base cost of a new home was up 33% in the last 2 years.

Commercial contractors noted that a general shortage of key components, including labor, remained a significant factor. Overall, commercial buyers remained hesitant to commit due to market uncertainty.

To combat labor shortages, firms reported investments in training to upskill employees and capital expenditures in technology to reduce reliance on labor. Overall turnover has eased somewhat but not among hourly paid staff, who continued to change jobs for higher pay. Several employers also noted that affordable housing and childcare availability and costs further restrained the supply of workers at all levels.

Contacts' forecasts for District agricultural income for 2023 were mostly for near average returns, down from an above average 2022. Wheat prices were up, in part because of longer Russian inspection times for Ukrainian grain shipments and buyers' greater reluctance to enter purchase agreements given uncertainty about whether the shipping deal with Russia would continue. Corn and soybean prices were also higher, spurred by uncertainty about the size of South American harvests. Contacts noted that lower costs for some inputs would help farm incomes but rising feed costs were a continuing concern for livestock producers. Egg prices dropped from extremely high levels, and dairy prices were generally lower. There were reports of closures of smaller dairy operations, for which higher interest rates on loans were making it more expensive to expand to a more profitable scale.

Prices have increased modestly since our previous report. Overall, contacts reported slowing price increases and projected lower rates of price growth in the year ahead. This year, 63 percent of respondents reported an ability to pass on costs, down from 82 percent a year ago. Some industries expect to see the pace of price increases slow more than others, with retail respondents projecting a 4 percent increase this year, compared with 14 percent a year ago. However, some industries expect to see prices increase by more than the previous year, with tourism respondents projecting increased prices of 5.2 percent this year, compared with 0.3 percent a year ago. A contact in the hotel industry estimated they would pass on 60-70 percent of costs to consumers. A contact in the automobile sales industry reported that increased inventory levels led to more competitive market pricing, keeping prices lower. Firms, especially smaller ones, reported accepting tighter profit margins instead of increasing prices.

District general retailers, auto dealers, and hospitality contacts reported mixed business activity and a mixed outlook. January real sales tax collections increased in Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas relative to December and decreased in West Tennessee. Retailers in St. Louis noted generally lower business activity due to customers cutting back on spending because of higher prices. District auto dealers reported generally steady business activity due to increased inventory, though they expected business activity may slow in the upcoming months due to higher interest rates. An auto dealer in Louisville reported they have been seeing new vehicle sales rates slowing. A restaurant contact in Memphis noted that demand continues to be steady even with food costs surging. District hospitality contacts noted that business activity was generally mixed, with demand moderated by rising costs.

Banking conditions in the District remain stable since our previous report. Overall loan demand remains largely unchanged from the past quarter. Commercial and industrial loan demand saw a small decline, while demand for mortgage loans moderately increased with the dip in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. Despite this recent growth, Memphis banking contacts expect mortgage lending to slow down in the coming month. Contacts also expect margins on interest-bearing deposits to contract as federal funds rate increases ease up and the resulting pressure from competition requires banks to pay higher interest rates. Credit and asset quality remain strong, and delinquency rates showed no significant change from the past quarter.

District agriculture conditions have declined moderately since our previous report. The number of acres of winter wheat planted in the District this season has increased by 27 percent compared with this period a year ago. These increases range from 15-55 percent across District states with the lone exception of Arkansas, which saw a moderate decrease of 14 percent. District contacts are no longer optimistic on the outlook for the rest of the year, due to concern about the increased cost of inputs, especially labor. Additionally, contacts noted sales were either at or below expectations, and some contacts expressed concern that higher interest rates were putting additional strain on their balance sheets.

Employment grew moderately since the last report. A survey of District firms in early February found a large majority hiring in some capacity. Less than 30 percent of employers said they were not hiring, and only 5 percent reported cutting workers. Other contacts also noted that firms were overhiring to ensure operational coverage or to create more attractive schedules that avoid overtime. Survey respondents from large firms reported notably better success at adding workers. Some contacts said that labor availability improved slightly, but overall it remained problematic. A recent Minneapolis-area job fair with more than 20 employers and hundreds of job openings attracted only 20 people. A Montana construction firm has found it economical to rent a jet to fly workers in to one of its plants to fill operational needs. Hiring local employees "would be our first choice, but we had to adjust when we could not staff that way."

Thirty percent of surveyed District firms reported annual wage increases of more than 5 percent, roughly in line with earlier surveys. A Minnesota contact reported that he was seeing "restaurants and hotels balk at moving any higher with wages. They feel they just can't adjust their prices any higher."

Price increases were modest overall since the last report amid some signs of easing inflationary pressures. Half of respondents to a monthly District business conditions poll reported no change to the prices they charged for their products and services in January from a month earlier, but a slight majority said their nonlabor input prices increased. Two-thirds of respondents either expected not to change their selling prices or to decrease them slightly in the coming month, though the outlook for input price increases remained elevated. According to a semiannual survey of businesses, about 2 in 5 firms reported "little or no change" in prices charged to customers over the past month. About half said wholesale prices from suppliers were modestly higher. Retail fuel prices in District states increased moderately since the last report.

Some workers formerly in food and hospitality said they quit their jobs in recent months to start their own businesses and have more control over their lives. "At the beginning, I was afraid to leave a job I had done for 15 years," shared a former cook. "I have been cleaning houses for a few months now, and I am much happier." More electrical engineering graduates from a District college were reportedly applying for jobs in smaller companies with competitive wages, a move they had snubbed in the past, according to a contact. In Minnesota, workforce development contacts said more people were applying for jobs but "ghosting" prospective employers. A labor contact in Minnesota said that the narrow workplace flexibility in education was pushing people out of the profession and into other fields. Many were leaving within the first five years, and fewer were entering preparation programs in the field.

Consumer spending fell slightly overall since the last report. More than 100 firms in retail, hospitality, and entertainment reported that recent revenues and profits were lower overall compared with the previous quarter and year over year. A western Wisconsin restaurant owner noted that "costs are much higher while guests are tightening their purse strings and not as willing to accept price increases." January gross sales in South Dakota grew compared with last year, but at the lowest monthly rate in over two years. A dealership with multiple locations reported that January vehicle sales rose 2 percent year over year, but new-vehicle sales dropped by 15 percent. Car and truck sales were also lower in Wisconsin, and sales of powersport and recreational vehicles remained lower across the District. Airline travel through District airports in January was higher year over year, with most seeing double-digit increases; Minneapolis-St. Paul International traffic rose 6 percent.

Commercial construction fell slightly since the last report. Some of that slowdown was seasonal. A manufacturer of building products said that "November through January are our weakest months. But the trend is down." A Montana architecture firm said that large corporate clients have delayed project starts. Other contacts reported a smaller pipeline of future projects. A contractor in Minneapolis-St. Paul said, "Interest rate hikes have put a considerable damper on new construction projects.…Projects aren't penciling out." Residential construction was lower. Single-family units permitted in December and January fell by half compared with a year earlier in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Billings, Montana, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota saw larger declines. Most other major markets were flat.

Commercial real estate was flat since the last report. Office space continued to struggle overall despite a slow but ongoing return of workers to downtown offices. But overall vacancy rates grew as some large tenants downsized and space available for sublease increased. Industrial property remained strong, though higher financing costs reportedly had some developers reevaluating speculative projects. Residential real estate continued to crater. Most large markets in the District saw closed sales fall between 25 and 50 percent in December and January year over year.

District agricultural conditions remained strong heading into the end of winter. According to the Minneapolis Fed's fourth quarter (January) agricultural credit conditions survey, nearly three-quarters of lenders reported farm incomes increased from October through December compared with the same period a year earlier. Farm household spending, capital spending, and loan repayment rates also increased on balance, while demand for loans fell. A forestry contact noted that prices that sawmills were paying for logs had increased recently, leading to operating losses and production cuts at mills. Production at District iron ore mines was expected to increase slightly in 2023; one facility was making a large investment into producing a higher grade of ore. District oil and gas exploration activity was unchanged since the previous report.

Minority-and women-owned businesses reported steady activity in recent weeks. Labor market tightness continued to put uneven pressure on minority and women entrepreneurs. A childcare provider said that despite higher demand for services, they cannot find qualified staff to maximize their licensed capacity: "Parents want their children to learn Spanish, they look for that added value in our services, but finding staff is a big challenge." Electricians, plumbers, framers, cosmetologists, and other workers requiring certifications were also said to be in short supply. Contacts highlighted that while more people were looking at entrepreneurship as an alternative to employment, many faced challenges like access to capital, lack of credit history, lack of understanding of business processes, and lack of management and marketing skill.

Total economic activity across the Tenth District fell slightly in February. Consumer spending continued to decline, primarily due to reduced discretionary spending on leisure and retail, while non-discretionary spending on food, energy, and healthcare continued to rise. Several contacts noted declines in workers' overtime hours, less hiring of temp workers, and fewer new job openings. However, employment levels remained high and labor market conditions continued to be tight. Contacts reported labor costs were elevated and indicated more difficulty in passing these costs to customers in recent weeks. In the housing sector, contacts highlighted the elevated levels of mobility of residents as an opportunity for rental property managers to raise rents more frequently, leading to faster rent growth on an annual basis. The recent surge in rent prices was reportedly a headwind to financing for new multifamily housing development, as the uncertainty about how to estimate future revenue growth from housing properties squelched new projects. Community bankers reported low past due and problem loan levels. Although some bankers highlighted concerns regarding future consumer credit performance, most respondents expected credit quality to remain largely unchanged over the next six months.

Tenth District contacts reported that employment increased moderately over the past few weeks, though the pace of hiring has significantly slowed from its recent elevated level. Businesses continue to report difficulty finding qualified workers to fill open positions, reflecting ongoing tightness in the labor market. Labor force participation declined in most District states over the last few months, further constraining labor supply for businesses seeking to fill open positions. Business contacts continued to report difficulty hiring for entry-level positions, but in recent weeks indicated they are focused on hiring for both entry-level and mid-level positions over the next six months.

Though overall consumer spending declined, businesses noted a bifurcation in spending patterns. Discretionary and more interest rate sensitive consumption categories – such as travel and car purchases – declined at a rapid pace, while spending on non-discretionary consumption categories – such as food, energy, and healthcare – increased modestly.

Low to moderate income (LMI) households in the Tenth District reported greater difficulty securing adequate childcare over the past few months. Contacts cited both a lack of availability and rising costs at childcare facilities as the major barriers faced by households seeking care. Insufficient childcare availability and unaffordability continued to hinder workforce participation among LMI households. Recent policy efforts to improve childcare availability – for example, a recent zoning reform in Wichita, Kansas increased maximum home daycare capacity from 10 to 12 children – have reportedly been more than offset by an acceleration of closures of childcare facilities.

Developers of multifamily housing indicated further deterioration of conditions from already depressed levels. Rising interest rates continue to be a challenge to financing multifamily housing projects, but contacts also highlighted recent volatility in rental rates as an additional headwind. Uncertainty about projected rent growth is reportedly very high, further hindering financing activities for new projects. Builders of single-family homes reported costs associated with higher interest rates are exacerbated by ongoing delays related to delivery of materials, inspections, and worker shortages. Such delays raise the effective cost of higher rates for builders because that interest expense must be carried over a longer period.

Contacts reported weaker demand across all key portfolios but highlighted stable credit quality last month amid low past due and problem loan levels. Although some contacts highlighted concerns regarding future retail credit performance, respondents expected credit quality to remain largely unchanged over the next six months. Deposit levels declined moderately again this month as banks experienced strong rate pressure from other bank and non-bank competitors amidst increases in short-term interest rates. Further, deposits rotated from checking and noninterest-bearing accounts into time deposits and high-yield savings products as customers demanded additional yield on cash.

Tenth District energy activity fell slightly over the last month. The number of newly drilled and completed wells declined, as profitability for drillers began to fall for the first time in two years. Oil prices were roughly flat over the last month and crude oil stocks increased due to unscheduled refinery maintenance, contributing to the recent declines in District rig counts. On average, natural gas rig counts across District states are expected to decline over coming months, driven by generally lower domestic natural gas prices. However, there were some differences among District states. The number of gas rigs ticked up in Wyoming, as regional (western) natural gas prices were elevated. Additionally, Wyoming coal miners saw strong production growth related to higher coal prices in recent months.

The farm economy in the Tenth District remained strong, but risks to the outlook lingered. In the livestock sector, cattle prices increased slightly in February and reached multi-year highs alongside lower inventories. In the crop sector, prices of corn, soybeans and wheat remained high and continued to support profitability. Despite strong market conditions, District contacts reported that elevated production costs, higher interest rates, and ongoing drought in some areas have put downward pressures on profit margins for many producers. Cost pressures have been particularly challenging for livestock operations, with several reports of early calf sales and herd liquidation as a result of intense drought and high feed costs, which could reduce revenues going forward.

While several firms continued to cite difficulty recruiting for open positions, many others reported an improvement in both the quality and quantity of applicants. Airlines cited capacity constraints due to pilot staffing issues, and one health care contact said they were lowering education and licensing requirements for several hundred job openings to expand the applicant pool. Some small or rural school districts in Texas have transitioned to a four-day school week in part due to staffing shortages and the need to attract teachers. In contrast, several firms noted hiring to cover turnover rather than to expand payrolls, and contacts in the education sector said there were less job opportunities for graduating students, particularly in high tech. There were reports of hiring freezes or layoffs in construction, manufacturing, financial services, and professional and business services.

Texas factory output dipped slightly during the reporting period after increasing modestly in December. New orders for manufactured goods continued to decline for both durables and nondurables in part due to falling backlogs, inventory realignment, economic uncertainty, and slowing construction activity. Weakness in demand was most pronounced in construction-related manufacturing, though computer and electronic product and food manufacturers cited declines as well. Refinery utilization rates slipped, but margins remained healthy. Overall, economic uncertainty remained elevated, and outlooks weakened.

Evictions ticked up, and contacts said that higher interest rates and home prices were eroding the impact of down payment assistance programs. Lack of affordable childcare was another primary issue, impeding employment for lower-income women. Nonprofits expressed concern that high operating costs together with the recent decline in public funding would limit their capacity to provide services. A contact at a public university reported that enrollment was solid but the cost of attendance and the ability to pay tuition remained a challenge for students from low to moderate income households, particularly in light of the depletion of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF).

Hiring activity grew modestly during the reporting period. Labor supply improved somewhat across most sectors, allowing employers to fill long-standing job vacancies. Firms reported higher applicant counts and lower staff turnover rates in many sectors, including finance, tourism, and agriculture. Despite improved labor availability, competition remained tight across skill levels, including for positions in food services, hospitality, construction, health care, and manufacturing. In fact, labor market tightness continued to be an issue for many providers for consumer services, except for those in the technology industry. Additionally, contacts in both health care and business services reported an increased demand for part-time positions in recent weeks. Many financial firms either slowed their hiring or contracted somewhat their employee head counts due to fewer real estate loan originations in an elevated interest rate environment. Other contacts reported stable employment levels, reduced job postings, or hiring freezes due to slowing demand and increased uncertainty. Contacts in the technology, entertainment, and transportation sectors mentioned that layoffs have either continued or are being considered as firms seek cost-cutting strategies amid lower demand.

Retail sales were strong overall but started to show signs of softening in recent weeks, in part due to consumers' rising credit card debt. Shopping centers experienced softer retail sales despite strong foot traffic. Reports also indicated that more consumers substituted usual purchases with lower quality or less expensive products, when possible, to compensate for higher prices. One retailer noticed that elevated energy prices led to moderated spending at the gas pump in recent weeks. These customers reportedly spent the freed-up funds at convenience stores located at the fuel stations. A specialty retailer with a national presence highlighted that inventory levels were stable.

One contact observed that producers continued to shift sales to domestic markets, and another commented that domestic demand has been high enough to largely absorb available supply. However, demand for produce from retailers and food services providers was reportedly either stable or down in recent weeks. Contacts continued to report low crop yields due to drought conditions, while a contact in Alaska noted continued stability in some major seafood stocks. Input costs, such as labor, energy, water, and fertilizer, increased, though one contact in the Pacific Northwest noted that food transportation costs fell substantially.

Airline passenger traffic through Boston increased steadily in recent months, on both domestic and international routes, reaching roughly 95 percent of pre-pandemic levels as of the first quarter of 2023. The Greater Boston hotel occupancy rate increased relative to seasonal trends, and spring and summer bookings continued to climb. Scheduled convention activity and cruise bookings for the spring and summer are expected to exceed 2019 levels.

Manufacturing contacts reported mixed revenue results, but demand was moderately softer on balance. Some contacts reported modestly higher sales but also said that the pace of revenue growth had slowed recently. For one firm, overall results were hit by a steep slowdown in demand from customers in the semiconductor industry. Others experienced weaker sales as their customers continued to draw on inventories accumulated in 2022 in response to supply chain concerns. A contact in the semiconductor industry said that industry sales were down but that their own sales were up due to investment demand from electric car manufacturers. None of our contacts reported major revisions to capital expenditure plans, and a few pointed to increased spending on automation. Contacts were generally optimistic for their own results for the rest of 2023, although several described the outlook for the economy more broadly as highly uncertain.

Demand for software and IT services was stable on balance. Revenue growth at one firm exceeded expectations, and another experienced an ongoing pullback by clients facing internal liquidity concerns. Profits and margins were modestly higher on average. Capital and technology spending was unchanged and was expected to hold steady for most firms, although one mentioned the possibility that capital expenditures could soften moving forward. Contacts were largely optimistic and expected demand for their own products and services to hold steady moving forward. Although one contact perceived that the risk of a widespread banking crisis had abated recently, another contact felt that nervousness about the banking sector could dampen aggregate economic activity.

Commercial real estate activity in the First District was mostly unchanged since February. In the industrial property market, rents continued to level off even though leasing demand was still deemed strong relative to supply. Office leasing activity was mostly flat, although contacts noted a modest slowing of deal flow in both Boston and Providence. Office asking rents were roughly stable, but one contact noted that tenants demanded (and on balance received) increasingly generous concessions. Conditions in the retail market worsened slightly in response to patches of weakness in consumer spending, and as a result firms became more cautious with capital spending. Concerning the outlook, contacts expected to see slight to moderate further declines in office and retail leasing activity moving forward, and perceived growing constraints on investment activity. In particular, several contacts predicted that lending to the commercial real estate sector would become more conservative in response to heightened concerns about banking risks, and one expressed that the credit contraction could be large enough to spill over to other sectors of the economy.

First District home sales softened in February (the latest month for which data were available) following a temporary uptick in sales in January that was attributed to a slight—yet partly transient—decline in mortgage rates. Closed single-family sales were down sharply on a year-over-year basis, and in Boston dipped to their lowest level in over a decade. Condo sales were roughly flat since the previous report. Inventories grew over-the-year on balance, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than was reported last time, and several contacts noted that the supply of homes for sale remained extremely limited. Home prices showed signs of softening amid growing buyer frustration over the lack of home affordability. Median single-family home prices nonetheless posted modest year-over-year increases on balance, a fact that one contact attributed to a decline in the proportion of starter homes on the market, although the median home price in Boston was down moderately from a year earlier. Looking ahead, contacts expressed concerns that low inventories and high mortgage rates could dampen activity during the typically busy spring sales season.

Economic activity in the Second District was little changed in the latest reporting period. The labor market has remained solid: employment increased slightly despite ongoing difficulty finding workers, wages continued to increase, and many businesses plan to add staff in the months ahead. Inflationary pressures eased somewhat but remained widespread. Supply availability, while still constrained, continued to improve, and goods production picked up noticeably. Consumer spending was flat to up slightly in recent weeks, while tourism has continued to strengthen. The home sales market has continued to pick up and the rental market has been steady. On balance, commercial real estate markets were mostly unchanged. Conditions in the broad finance sector deteriorated sharply, coinciding with recent stress in the banking sector. Regional banks continued to report widespread declines in loan demand, ongoing credit tightening, and modestly rising mortgage delinquency rates. Amid heightened uncertainty, most businesses do not expect economic conditions to improve in the coming months.

Labor market conditions have remained solid. On balance, employment increased slightly in the latest reporting period despite ongoing difficulty finding workers across the region. However, businesses in the manufacturing, construction, and education & health sectors indicated that employment declined in recent weeks. Even so, contacts at two major employment agencies noted ongoing strong labor demand and continued to indicate that worries of widespread weakening in the labor market have not materialized. Indeed, thus far, layoffs have been concentrated in large companies, and mostly among their workers who are outside of the region. Further, a New York City employment agency indicated that the broader local labor market has yet to experience noticeable ripple effects from recent stress in the banking sector. Looking ahead, on net, businesses plan to add staff in the coming months.

Tourism activity in New York City continued to strengthen and is nearing pre-pandemic levels. While domestic travel remains strong, international travel continues to lag. Visitors from Asia—especially China—remain noticeably absent, in part due to long wait times for visas. Though business travel has yet to fully bounce back, it has picked up beyond expectations in recent weeks. Demand for hotel rooms continued to increase with advance bookings trending up as people have grown more comfortable traveling. Even with the steady uptick in visitors to New York City, the reduction in daily commuters continues to exert pressure on the City's retailers and entertainment-related businesses.

Residential sales have picked up with the start of the spring selling season, with prices steady at a high level. Sales activity in and around New York City has continued to increase beyond the seasonal norm. By contrast, real estate contacts in upstate New York indicated that the spring selling season has gotten off to a slower start in part due to unseasonably harsh weather, though demand remains strong for homes in the middle of the region's price range. While listings have increased, the inventory of available homes has remained exceptionally low across the region except in Manhattan. Contacts pointed to heightened uncertainty and the prevalence of homeowners with mortgages locked in at historically low rates as key factors keeping some people from listing their homes and moving.

Nonlabor input cost pressures eased in recent weeks, continuing a trend that started last summer. Several contacts reported that their overall costs had flattened. One homebuilder said he recently started "pressing people to lower [their] prices but haven't had much success yet." That said, contacts in construction and manufacturing noted that costs for steel and concrete products increased recently. One steel producer said that he expected steel costs to rise further in the second quarter, but he expected costs to fall in the third quarter. More broadly, contacts expected further relief from input cost pressures in the months ahead.

Overall selling-price pressures eased from those of the prior reporting period, but they varied across industries. On the one hand, natural gas prices fell amid mild winter and early spring weather, and freight prices decreased because of a drop in demand. On the other hand, some manufacturers said they continued to raise prices to "catch up" from the cost increases over the prior two years. Similarly, some retail contacts reported selectively raising prices to cover higher costs, though they did so cautiously to remain competitive.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from February 27, 2023 to April 10, 2023.
Reports suggest that consumer spending firmed somewhat from that of the previous reporting period. Still, demand for discretionary items remained soft as households faced continued pressure from inflation and increased interest rates. One general merchandiser noted that higher prices for food and other essentials continued "eating up more of the customer's wallet," leading customers to favor lower-priced options such as generic brands. Auto sales dipped in part because increasing interest rates and higher vehicle prices pushed out of the market many buyers who want, rather than need, a new vehicle. One dealer hoped that more manufacturer incentives would increase demand, but he cautioned that higher credit standards had become an additional headwind for potential buyers. On balance, contacts expected consumer spending to remain stable in the coming months.

Overall demand for manufactured goods increased slightly from that in the previous period. Orders for aerospace-related products remained strong, but demand generally weakened for items from manufacturers tied to the housing and automotive sectors. Some manufacturers benefitted from an increase in international orders, particularly from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. That said, heightened uncertainty tempered some manufacturers' expectations because of a decrease in new orders and backlogs.

Demand for residential construction and real estate continued to be hindered by higher interest rates. One homebuilder stated, "As long as interest rates stay high, demand is going to be down. We're still selling, but it's down from where it was a year ago." Given low inventories, some builders reported that demand for housing seems stronger than expected. Some builders are attempting to offset higher interest rates through various incentives, including rate buydowns.

Nonresidential construction and real estate contacts indicated that demand had changed little in recent weeks on balance. While a few contacts reported that projects had been put on hold, others indicated they have still been able to secure new projects. One general contractor noted that demand had remained stable, but projects were taking longer to get started because the firm had been spending more time working on budgeting issues in the preconstruction phase. Several contacts anticipated construction and leasing activity to soften further in coming weeks because of rising interest rates and banks' tightening credit.

Overall, loan demand continued to decrease, albeit at a slower pace than in the prior period. Several bankers reported that recent developments in the sector added to heightened economic uncertainty that motivated customers to reach out about the safety of their deposits. Others posited that the increased uncertainty along with high interest rates had reduced borrowing. Lenders indicated that delinquency rates remained low for both commercial and consumer loans. Core deposits continued to decline, a situation which bankers attributed to rate competition among banks and to outflows to higher-yielding alternatives. Looking forward, loan demand was expected to soften further in coming months.

Nonprofit contacts reported increased demand for their services over the past six months because of rising costs for food, shelter, and utilities. One contact noted that food pantry use is up 30 percent compared to prepandemic levels, and another mentioned an increase in the number of first-time users of food assistance. Several contacts said that homelessness was rising and that more families were moving in with relatives because of higher rents, increased evictions, and a shortage of affordable housing. According to multiple contacts, fewer landlords were accepting Section 8 vouchers, a situation which contributed to the housing shortage. Some contacts who offer loan products to households and businesses noted that rising interest rates increased the demand for their products. One community service provider saw a rise in applications for zero-interest, small-dollar loans, and a community development financial institution contact reported that more individuals were seeking funding through her enterprise because of higher interest rates at local banks.

The Fifth District economy contracted slightly since our previous report. Manufacturing activity softened as new orders fell and more customers started pushing back on price increases. District ports and trucking companies reported declines in freight volumes, particularly a sharp decline in import volumes, leading to lower shipping and trucking spot rates. Consumer spending on retail goods and autos slowed slightly; however, spending on tourism and travel increased moderately. Residential real estate markets softened as closings and pending sales declined while listing prices held flat. Commercial real estate activity declined, on balance. The retail and industrial real estate segments remained strong; however, the remaining segments, particularly office, softened. Financial institutions continued to report modest declines in loan demand. Deposit levels also declined, on balance, despite some institutions reporting an inflow of deposits from new clients. Demand for nonfinancial services was unchanged in recent weeks. Employment rose slightly and wages increased moderately, due in part to recent minimum wage increases in some Fifth District jurisdictions. Price growth remained robust; however, there were several reports that customers were starting to reject further price increases or insist on reduced prices.

Employment increased slightly in the Fifth District over the most recent reporting period. Contacts continued to report a lack of qualified workers as a significant issue for their business. A Maryland construction contact reported better than expected demand, but projects were slowed by a shortage of skilled labor. A South Carolina staffing firm said that demand for engineering and skilled trades workers has been consistently high and doesn't show signs of slowing. Wages picked-up moderately, due in part from increases in the minimum wages in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. A Virginia retailer reported that the minimum wage increase resulted in wage increase for all workers, not just those making the minimum.

Prices continued to grow at a strong rate, particularly for services. According to our recent surveys, manufacturers reported average price increases around 5.5 percent, but this was down considerably from the peak set in 2022. Services sector firms, on the other hand, saw prices continue to rise at a near-peak rate of about 6.5 percent. There were some reports by firms in both sectors that customers were starting to push back on further price increases. One manufacturer said that they were under pressure to cut prices, which would compress margins as input costs were still rising.

Manufacturing activity in the Fifth District softened modestly in recent weeks. Overall, manufacturers reported a decline in new orders. A fabric manufacturer that produces products for retail stores said that they were working through an inventory glut, and were hoping that as inventories clear, new orders would increase. Manufacturers also reported more push-back from clients on price increases. A label printer reported increased pressure from purchasing teams to reduce pricing this year. With supply chain pressures easing, purchasing teams were "raging back and shopping the business." Finding workers remained an issue. An aluminum producer cited that growth is limited severely by availability of skilled labor and administrative workers.

Fifth District ports reported a sharp decline in loaded import volumes this period. Imports of retail goods and household related items were down. Additionally, due to the extended Chinese New Year, there was an increase in blank sailings. Loaded exports were stronger and driven by auto and machine parts as well as rolling stock. Empty containers were dwelling slightly longer at the port. Shipping carriers had excess availability this period. Spot rates fell to pre-pandemic levels or below and were significantly under current contract rates. Air cargo demand continued to soften with airfreight rates stabilizing as airlines pulled back on freight capacity.

Trucking firms reported a moderate decline in freight volumes this period. Respondents indicated that there was excess capacity in the truck load segment but less-than truckload demand was not down as much. Spot market rates decreased slightly with carriers experiencing some push back from customers on further rate increases. Trucking firms stated that in response to lower freight volumes, they were still adding drivers, but they had scaled-back recruiting and were being very selective in hiring. Availability of new tractors and trailers from manufactures continued to improve and there was a glut of used trucks on the market due to a few regional trucking companies going out of business.

Similarly, an appliance and electronics store saw a slowdown in demand and customer traffic. A couple of retailers, however, noted that their typical busy season doesn't start until April, so they were expecting business to pick up soon.

Residential real estate respondents noted that so far it hasn't been the typical robust spring market, evidenced by a decline in both sales and pending sales. Days on market have increased, but still not above the historic average; housing inventory has decreased year-over-year with substantially less new listings. Sales prices have remained flat for this period, but new contracts were starting to come in at less than list price. Many potential home buyers were priced out and sellers were having to offer concessions to close deals. Higher mortgage rates have made finding affordable homes even more of a challenge. Construction costs were down, but overall, home builders are no longer acquiring new building lots due to economic uncertainty.

Overall commercial real estate market activity decreased in the last month, particularly in the office sector. Retail and industrial/flex space leasing remained robust this period. The industrial market continued to be strong with higher rental rates and good absorption rates. However, rents were moderating in other commercial real estate sectors and landlords were increasing their incentives and concessions. Rising interest rates slowed sales and commercial real estate capital markets activity was negligeable. Some banks had stopped lending for new commercial construction projects and/or had tightened underwriting standards; many equity lenders also had left the market. Many respondents cited a looming issue of certain CMBS loans that are coming due in 2023 being unable to qualify for refinancing.

Consumer loan demand was mixed, with home equity and used auto loans showing some increased demand over the last few months. Consumer mortgage demand, especially refinancings, have slowed, which contacts attributed to rising rates. Deposit levels declined slightly, on balance, however a few banks did see an inflow of deposits following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Loan delinquencies continued to increase, albeit slightly and still not to pre-covid levels.

However, businesses continued to cite challenges including acute shortages of various positions (for example, in hospitality, accounting and transportation), confronting an aging labor force, and facing sustained demand for flexible work arrangements by employees. Most firms have been hiring to back-fill open positions while a small number were hiring to grow business. Several firms noted efforts to move away from underperforming lines of business by downsizing through both attrition and layoffs while staffing up more profitable lines. Contacts noted turning to automation to fill repetitive, understaffed roles, and some have begun to leverage the use of artificial intelligence in lieu of hiring for certain professional positions.

Contacts reported continued improvement in supply chain issues and shipping capacity, which has helped ease transportation cost pressures. Even though contracts still carried elevated escalation or contingency clauses, some degradation in pricing power at the wholesale level was reported. Buyers were reportedly winning more concessions compared to the last two years of a take-it-or-lose-it price environment. However, various other nonlabor costs like food inputs and construction materials saw continued volatility and this, coupled with elevated labor costs, kept firms from passing easing cost pressures on to customers. The Atlanta Fed's Business Inflation Expectations survey showed year-over-year unit cost growth at 3.8 percent, on average, in March, up significantly from 3.5 percent in February. Firms' year-ahead inflation expectations increased to 3.1 percent, on average in March, up significantly from 2.9 percent in February.

Though still weaker than a year ago, housing demand throughout most of the District was boosted by lower mortgage interest rates and continued declines in home prices. A higher percentage of homes have sold below asking price and median home prices in many metro areas declined from peak levels reached in 2022. This, combined with lower interest rates, has led to a steady improvement in home ownership affordability and increased demand for housing. Activity has been stronger in the entry-level price points compared to more high-end homes. However, inventory remained near historic lows in most markets. Cancellations in the new home market moderated and some homebuilders have increased speculative home inventory.

With input costs remaining elevated and many product prices down, contacts expected lower agricultural income for the District in 2023 compared with a strong 2022. Wheat prices were generally lower over the reporting period, during which the agreement for exporting grain from Ukraine was extended into May. Corn and soybean prices were also lower despite smaller estimates for the South American harvest. Planting delays were likely in some places in the District due to excess precipitation, though contacts noted the extra moisture could also recharge ground water levels for use later in the growing season. Although fertilizer costs fell, the cost of most other inputs remained high for crop farms. Cattle prices increased as the U.S. herd was squeezed by drought and a harsh winter. Egg prices moved up, while dairy and hog prices were down. High feed costs continued to compress most livestock margins. Prices for agricultural land continued to rise, reportedly at a slower pace.

Despite increasing input costs, business contacts reported a decreased ability to pass on costs to consumers due to increased price sensitivity of consumers and the desire to maintain competitive pricing. Of businesses that reported the ability to increase prices, the projected change in prices varied. A contact in the car industry indicated only slight increases in prices, while a contact in the hospitality industry estimated a larger 6-10 percent increase in prices.

A St. Louis auto dealer reported that business activity did not change over the past month, and they have a positive outlook for spring and summer. This dealer also noted that sales of luxury cars have not decreased, since the people who buy luxury cars are typically cash buyers and they are less affected by interest rates. A restaurant contact in Memphis reported that business has been stable, and they are careful about increasing prices to avoid driving away customer demand. The hospitality industry in Louisville is pessimistic about the tourism industry's chances of returning activity to pre-pandemic levels.

In Northwest Mississippi, access to rural healthcare continues to be affected by rising costs and low Medicare reimbursements, which have caused hospitals to delay investment in new structures and services. Investment in technical training increased across the District. A community college in Tennessee has partnered with local businesses to provide customized work-centered training and short-term credentials to address student concerns about the rising cost of education and local business concerns about the lack of qualified workers. Similarly, community colleges in the St. Louis area are investing in advanced manufacturing training programs by procuring high-end equipment, building new facilities, and developing new curriculums to accommodate more students. Memphis-area nonprofits reported that volunteer engagement has increased since our previous report.

A monthly business conditions survey showed that overall hiring sentiment remained positive; staffing contacts also noted increases in job orders with the coming of spring. Layoffs appeared to increase, but mass layoff events were still low. A Minnesota staffing firm said that businesses were "exfoliating the workers they don't need." A Wisconsin workforce contact said that hiring had softened; there was not widespread downsizing, but more the "abandonment" of recruiting for unfilled positions. Several sources noted that turnover also appeared to be ebbing and could be a factor in lower job postings. Numerous contacts said labor availability improved slightly. A Wisconsin staffing contact said the number of job applicants rose "but the quality is not strong." Still, job placements were growing because clients "are becoming more open to more-questionable candidates."

Vehicle sales in Minnesota and Wisconsin in March were lower compared with last year; in the western part of the District, sales at a dealership with multiple locations were slightly higher for new vehicles, despite inventory shortages, but 12 percent lower for used vehicles. Recreational, powersport, and marine vehicle sales remained subdued, with the RV industry "bloated with inventory," according to a contact, and higher interest rates dampening demand. Spring break airline traffic has been brisk, with monthly passenger levels at some District airports seeing double-digit growth over last year.

Hiring activity slowed, leaving total District employment mostly unchanged. Worker retention was reportedly much higher, even as wage growth slowed. Consumer spending declined slightly. Households pulled back most on bigger ticket items like cars or home maintenance and improvements. Prices continued to rise at a moderate pace. Several food manufacturers indicated they do not expect to be able to negotiate the same pace of price increases as they did over the past year in the coming months. Deposit outflows at community and regional banking organizations raised funding challenges for many organizations in recent weeks. However, community development financial institutions, which typically serve microbusinesses and low-to-moderate income borrowers, reported stable funding conditions despite recent financial volatility. Agricultural lenders also indicated stable liquidity to support lending over the medium term. Generally, lenders expected somewhat tighter lending standards and stricter pricing related to credit risks in coming months.

Restaurant owners, hotel operators and most service businesses indicated that employment changed little over the past month. Although employment in healthcare grew at a moderate pace over the last month, labor demand at healthcare establishments slowed moderately in some parts of the District. Job losses in tech occupations were concentrated among larger companies operating in the region. Contacts noted that tech workers were finding new employment opportunities within a couple of weeks on average, but often at somewhat lower pay. Expected employment growth was reportedly much lower than just a few months ago.

Most businesses said their recent difficulty with passing cost increases through to customers compressed their profit margins, with most indicating they expect to increase prices further over the medium term to rebuild lost profitability. One notable exception was processed food categories, where contacts do not expect to be able to negotiate as large, or as many, price increases with grocers as they did last year.

CDFIs expect strong and increasing loan demand as an alternative and competitive lender to commercial banks, especially as banks tighten credit. Looking ahead, several CDFIs reported concerns about the ability of businesses to pay on loans, especially as more Economic Impact Disaster Loan payment deferments continue to expire throughout the year.

In contrast, District contacts in the venture capital and start-up space reported a much more adverse outlook compared to just a couple of months ago as a direct result of the closure and challenges among the key lenders to the sector. Businesses tended to point to prolonged declines expected for the start-up ecosystem, rather than declines in certain segments of the startup community, such as life/bio sciences or tech services.

Vacancy rates at commercial properties increased moderately in recent weeks, most notably at office properties. Yet, contacts indicated use of warehousing and distribution space, which had been the strongest property segment over the last year, declined over the past month. Several contacts noted subleasing prices declined further. Following the recent financial market volatility, most contacts noted that lending for commercial real estate development is almost completely unavailable. From the lender side, one contact commented "we'd already been focusing only on premium deals, but now we are being even stricter about what 'premium' means."

After tightening credit standards over the past several weeks, many contacts reported expectations for further tightening or more strict pricing related to credit risks. Loan demand also weakened modestly in the past month, driven by increased borrowing costs and economic uncertainty. Most notably, contacts reported weaker demand in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, though declines were broad-based. Credit quality remained stable, but contacts continued to expect loan quality to deteriorate over the next six months. Deposit levels declined moderately as large depositors withdrew uninsured balances amid the volatility in the regional banking sector and ongoing intensity of rate competition.

Tenth District energy activity declined moderately over recent months. The number of active gas rigs in the District decreased as natural gas prices continued to decline below profitable levels, and prices were expected to remain in an unprofitable range over coming months. However, declines in the number of active oil rigs were modest, as firms expect oil prices to remain in a profitable range in the near term, albeit with profitability falling in recent months. In line with these expectations, oil producers reported access to credit over the last month remained unchanged despite banking disruptions. The average price needed for a substantial increase in drilling to occur remains above near-term oil and gas price expectations, constraining future production growth. Most business contacts reported higher cost pressures across several key inputs and anticipate persistent cost pressures in the coming year. Accordingly, capital spending growth slowed relative to last year and is expected to decline over the next six months.

Agricultural economic and credit conditions in the Tenth District were reportedly strong. Elevated commodity prices continued to support profit opportunities for many producers. Farm loan repayment rates improved at a gradual pace in the first quarter and indicators of credit challenges were limited. Agricultural bankers throughout the region also reported that their liquidity was adequate to meet current credit demand and deposit withdrawals. The impact of higher interest rates on borrower finances and farmland markets was reportedly a growing concern. More broadly, drought and elevated production costs continued to affect many areas of the region.

The Eleventh District economy continued to expand modestly. Manufacturing output rose slightly following a mild contraction in the previous period. Growth in the service sector continued at a modest pace, and retail sales and energy activity were flat. Loan demand weakened further, loan volumes fell, and credit conditions tightened. Agricultural conditions remained strained by drought in some areas. Home sales rose. Local nonprofits cited higher demand for assistance. Overall payrolls rose modestly, though hiring slowed sharply in the service sector. Wage growth remained elevated, while price pressures eased notably. Outlooks worsened, and uncertainty surged, partly due to heightened apprehension about the recent banking sector issues and high interest rates, and their spillover effects on the broader economy.

Employment increased modestly during the reporting period. The pace of hiring picked up in manufacturing but slowed in energy and nearly stalled out in services. Difficulty hiring workers remained a top concern for many firms, though a few reported some improvement. Airlines cited capacity constraints due to pilot shortages, and a workforce development contact said some employers were taking a closer look at non-traditional talent pipelines to fill positions. In contrast, staffing firms noted clients were taking longer to make hiring decisions in part due to the increased economic uncertainty, and there were scattered reports of layoffs in construction-related manufacturing and upstream energy.

While input costs continued to rise, the pace of increases moderated in energy, construction, and manufacturing. Freight costs dipped. Some manufacturers noted continued price pressures from supply chain constraints, and a few firms said higher borrowing costs were slowing down expansion plans. Selling price pressures decelerated broadly, bringing price growth close to or below its historical average in manufacturing and services. Homebuilders continued to use incentives and discounts to close sales. Airlines said ticket prices remained elevated, while energy firms reported declining rental rates for drilling rigs and said they expect cost inflation to continue slowing. More than a third of firms responding to a March Dallas Fed survey of nearly 400 Texas business executives cited inflation as a primary outlook concern over the next six months.

Texas factory output expanded slightly in March after declining in February. New orders for manufactured goods continued to contract, however. Weakness in demand was most pronounced in primary metals and plastics, though construction-related and computer manufacturers cited declines in new orders as well. In contrast, demand for fabricated metals and machinery rose, and chemical and refinery utilization rates increased. Overall, outlooks weakened, with just under two-thirds of contacts noting waning demand and/or recession as a key concern. Other headwinds cited were elevated input costs, labor shortages, and higher labor costs.

Small parcel and air cargo shipments were flat to down, while sea cargo volumes remained robust and were up notably compared with year-ago levels. One contact noted that the recent train derailments had increased supply chain delays. Airlines saw continuing solid demand for leisure travel and some contacts expect business travel revenues to reach pre-pandemic levels this spring. Demand for staffing services was mixed, with firms making white-collar placements seeing continued strong activity while those filling blue-collar positions citing weakness. Health care and real estate rental and leasing firms noted declining revenues on net.

Utilization of housing assistance or temporary shelters increased notably, and some nonprofits said that housing assistance was the fastest growing need among their clients. Contacts cited growing financial difficulties for low- to moderate-income families in part due to the recent reduction in SNAP benefits. One nonprofit noted that more middle-class families were seeking financial help as their wages had not kept pace with rising living costs. High or rising operating costs remained a challenge for many nonprofits, and some were concerned that with many companies downsizing, they would not meet their fundraising goals.

Business activity in the First District was about flat on balance. Retail sales increased modestly and restaurants enjoyed a seasonal uptick in activity in early May. Manufacturers posted mixed results, averaging modest revenue growth. Residential real estate sales were held back by inventory constraints, even though buyer demand strengthened moving into the spring season. Commercial real estate activity slowed moderately further, with new weakness in the suburban office market. Employment fell slightly amid broad declines in labor demand, and wage growth slowed somewhat. Prices increased at a modest pace on average, but some sizable price increases were noted. The outlook was cautiously optimistic on average, but the commercial real estate forecast weakened further on credit concerns.

Employment was down slightly amid muted hiring activity, and wage pressures eased a bit on balance. According to staffing industry contacts, labor demand slowed for a wide range of positions, including legal support and talent acquisition roles, as client firms trimmed hiring plans—though they so far have enacted no major layoffs. However, one manufacturing contact engaged in moderate layoffs related to receding demand for COVID-related products, and other manufacturers reduced labor by shedding temporary workers. Among restaurant industry contacts, hiring of waitstaff improved while back-of-house positions (e.g., chefs and managers) remained very hard to fill, resulting in further upward wage pressure for those roles. Retail headcounts were roughly steady, reflecting a combination of limited hiring and moderately lower attrition. According to staffing contacts, wage growth remained stable but workers seemed to lose bargaining power, as some employers at least partly rolled back flexible work arrangements. Contacts anticipated that selected wage pressures would persist but that average wage growth would decline considerably moving forward and that starting wages for some roles might even see slight declines through the end of 2023.

Retail prices were flat or down slightly as a result of increased promotions. Manufacturers and retailers alike said that freight and shipping costs declined further. Nonlabor cost pressures were mixed for restaurant owners, as wholesale food prices were flat in recent months but other costs such as rent, utilities, and health insurance increased further. The pricing outlook for the rest of 2023 was mixed, as most contacts expected to hold prices steady but some planned to post additional, above-average price hikes in response to ongoing cost pressures.

Among First District contacts, retail and restaurant sales increased modestly in recent weeks. An online retailer experienced an uptick in sales volume that was attributed in part to increased sales of outdoor furniture. Two discount retailers saw further modest improvements in sales volumes, pointing to their lower price points as a source of strength. A Massachusetts restaurant industry contact reported pockets of softer sales in April that were followed by broad improvements in recent weeks from Mother's Day and graduation celebrations, as well as from seasonal increases in outdoor dining. Despite growth in restaurant sales volume, profits continued to lag due to upward wage pressures and selected increases in nonlabor costs. Retail and restaurant contacts alike were cautiously optimistic for sustained modest growth for their own businesses in the near-term, but nonetheless cited concerns about the broader economy moving forward.

Reports from First District manufacturing contacts were mixed, but revenues increased modestly on balance. One manufacturer reported an abrupt decline in sales linked to the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry. A manufacturer of testing equipment said that sales were stable but short of expectations, in part related to slumping smartphone sales. A contact serving the scientific and life sciences industries said that revenue growth had returned to robust, prepandemic levels, in part owing to strong demand from China, although some of the firm's customers became more cautious in their spending. None of our contacts reported revisions to their capital expenditure plans. However, one contact heard that smaller peer firms were pulling back on spending on concerns about financing in the wake of recent bank failures. Looking ahead, contacts ranged from cautiously optimistic to very optimistic.

First District staffing contacts reported modest declines in revenue on balance through the second quarter of 2023, driven by decreased labor demand across many roles. Nonetheless, one firm reported sharply higher revenues from hiring for skilled manufacturing and engineering positions. Contacts described the recent slowdown in demand for staffing services as the continuation of a trend that began in late 2022 and that is expected to continue through the end of 2023. Contacts described the overall environment as one of caution, as firms anticipated a modest contraction in the economy. One contact noted further that demand for legal support roles had decreased, suggesting (in their view) that mergers and acquisitions might be slowing. Regarding the outlook, staffing firms expected their own revenues to hold relatively steady even with the anticipated further contractions in hiring.

In the First District, the commercial real estate market experienced a moderate decline in activity since April. In the industrial class, rents continued to level off and leasing began to slow due to a lack of available space. The office class saw a further slowing of deal flow, now impacting both the suburban and urban markets. Office rents were mostly stable but tenant allowances and other concessions increased further. The retail class was reportedly experiencing mixed conditions, with grocery-anchored and big-box retail spaces performing the best and the worst, respectively. On average, however, retail rents and leasing activity were unchanged since April. Across property types, investment sales slowed to a trickle and there was no new construction of note, facts attributed largely to financing difficulties. Looking ahead, contacts expected further declines in leasing and investment activity in both the office and retail property markets, with the office sector having the weaker outlook of the two. The industrial class is expected to see relatively stable activity, other than experiencing limited access to credit to finance new construction.

First District residential real estate sales ticked up slightly in March and April (the latest months for which data were available) in line with seasonal patterns, but continued to fall well short of year-earlier levels. Contacts around the District attributed the still-low sales numbers more to low inventories than to weak demand, as slightly lower mortgage rates helped bring more buyers to the market. Indeed, the Boston area enjoyed an above-average surge in single-family sales in March thanks to an uptick in inventories, and contacts reported a rise in instances of multiple offers and buyer concessions such as the waiving of inspections. Inventories were otherwise quite mixed, falling significantly from a year earlier in Massachusetts (outside of Boston) and Vermont, and down more modestly or flat elsewhere in the District. House price appreciation slowed on average but remained slightly positive, with the exception that home prices in Massachusetts (not including Boston) experienced modest declines from a year earlier. The modest price growth in the Boston area marked a reversal of trend from the preceding few months. Contacts anticipated that, despite healthy buyer demand, home sales would likely experience only a modest seasonal increase moving forward, owing to extremely low inventory levels.

Economic activity in the Second District declined at a moderate pace in the latest reporting period. Still, the labor market has remained solid, though the pace of hiring has slowed slightly, and wage growth was little changed. Inflationary pressures have remained persistent, with the pace of selling price increases picking up slightly in the service sector. Supply availability, while still constrained, continued to improve, though goods production was sluggish. Consumer spending continued to increase at a steady clip, and tourism in New York City is nearing pre-pandemic peaks. The home sales market and rental market have been strong, with record-high rents in New York City. Commercial real estate markets were mostly unchanged. Conditions in the broad finance sector continued to worsen. Regional banks reported ongoing tightening in credit conditions and declining loan demand. Amid heightened uncertainty, businesses expect little improvement in the months ahead.

Labor market conditions have remained solid, though there have been scattered signs of cooling as heightened uncertainty has made some businesses more cautious. While employment has continued to increase, on net, the pace of hiring has slowed slightly. Moreover, businesses in the construction, transportation, and finance sectors reported a significant decline in employment in recent weeks. Nonetheless, layoffs have generally remained concentrated in large companies outside the region. Though still challenging, it has become slightly easier to find workers—particularly for smaller businesses that have struggled to do so through much of the recovery. Still, a contact at a New York City employment agency indicated that labor demand has remained strong and that recent stress in the banking sector has not had broader impacts in the local labor market. A contact at an upstate New York employment agency noted strong demand for workers with leadership and technology skills. Contacts report that attrition rates remain exceptionally low.

Auto dealers in upstate New York reported that sales of new vehicles increased slightly as inventory continued to steadily improve, while sales of used vehicles softened. With elevated prices and more limited inventory of used vehicles, contacts noted that some consumers have opted instead for a new vehicle.

European tourists are returning in large numbers but lags in visa processing have continued to constrain visitors from China and parts of South America. Hotel performance has remained on a strong upward trend, and New York City has had the highest hotel occupancy rates of all the major markets in the country in recent weeks.

The residential sales market has been strong across the District in the latest reporting period. A New York City-area contact reported that the sales market in and around New York City has picked up strongly in recent weeks after a brief pause in early April due to uncertainty related to stress in the banking sector. After a slow start to the year, housing markets in upstate New York have also started to pick up, with bidding wars and multiple offers becoming more common. Inventory remains exceptionally low and is restraining sales activity in much of the District. A key factor suppressing new listings is the prevalence of homeowners with historically low interest rates on their existing mortgages, reducing the incentive to sell and move.

On balance, business activity in the Third District continued to decline slightly. Although the consumer sector appeared to be growing, contacts suggest that higher sales, in part, reflect inflated prices rather than volume. High interest rates are limiting listings of existing homes for sale, which has helped new home builders. Employment edged up as labor availability improved. Wage growth and inflation continued to subside. Wages continued to grow within a modest range, while inflation cooled to a modest range for the first time since early 2021. Overall, contacts reported far fewer supply chain disruptions – instead noting that many sectors of the economy are enjoying unusually high profit margins. Contacts continued to note tighter credit standards, although credit quality remains very good. On balance, most firms noted no evidence of a recession, and most expect modest economic growth over the next six months. However, current sentiment is quite negative, as contacts worry about banking sector woes and the debt ceiling crisis.

Consumer spending held steady, at best. One retailer reported strong sales, although underlying volumes may have softened. Several contacts noted that their suppliers or their competitors are maintaining high profit margins – that competition has not emerged to drive prices down for the consumer. Auto dealers reported a modest increase in sales as new car inventories grew. However, the mix is weighted toward high-margin cars, including expensive electric vehicles. Consumer reticence has prompted an increase in incentives.

Fourth District contact reports suggested little change in aggregate business activity, though conditions continued to vary by sector. Retail sales were relatively flat as a seasonal uptick in consumer services spending, such as at restaurants and tourist locations, was offset by weaker goods spending. Some manufacturing and freight contacts suggested that customers were drawing down inventories, a situation which constrained demand for their own goods and services. Housing markets stabilized with the start of the peak sales season. However, interest rates remained elevated and were reported to be constraining nonresidential construction. Bankers noted declines in commercial and consumer lending. A majority of contacts expressed some concern about the impasse in Congress over raising the debt ceiling, but, on balance, this issue did not appear to alter their expectations for business activity in the near term. Employment was stable in recent weeks. Wage growth remained elevated, particularly for bankers and manufacturers troubled by persistent hiring challenges. Nonlabor input cost pressures and price pressures changed little in recent weeks.

Employment was stable in recent weeks. Some manufacturing and construction firms reported delaying hiring because of economic uncertainty, while others were reducing "noncritical" staff to cut costs in preparation for future softer demand. In contrast, leisure and hospitality contacts reported a seasonal increase in staffing, as did one manufacturing contact who also mentioned that hiring was less difficult than in the recent past. That said, hiring remained challenging for many firms across industries. Most firms generally planned to hold headcount steady in coming months.

On balance, wage pressures changed little from those in the prior period. In banking and manufacturing, where hiring difficulties persisted, contacts continued to raise pay to attract and retain workers. However, several contacts were holding wages steady because hiring had become less difficult, while others mentioned that wage increases were no longer sustainable. One manufacturer was considering a one-time bonus rather than a pay increase to keep workers "happy and loyal" without embedding long-term labor-cost increases.

Nonlabor input cost pressures changed little in recent weeks. Manufacturers and retailers reported relief from increasing input costs, in particular for fuel, freight, and some raw materials. By contrast, contacts highlighted higher costs for steel and utilities and for electronics and electrical equipment that have been in short supply. Multiple contacts said that costs for business services continued to increase, and some posited these increases were linked to higher labor costs. On balance, contacts expected similar nonlabor input cost pressures to persist in coming months.

On balance, selling-price pressures were relatively unchanged, as well. Some contacts raised prices modestly to account for higher input costs, while others raised prices simply because strong demand allowed for it. One nonresidential builder said, "We're working to be as opportunistic as we can be." However, some manufacturers and restaurateurs reported that increased price sensitivity from customers limited their ability to raise prices. Multiple freight haulers reported a drop in rates because of weakened demand.

Consumer spending was mostly unchanged from that of the previous reporting period, though activity varied by sector. The arrival of spring boosted sales for tourist attractions and restaurants, with some restauranteurs describing better activity year over year. However, non-auto retailers generally experienced weaker sales. One department store contact reported a sharp sales decline in his stores that he said had "worsened throughout March and April." Another contact suggested that some retailers had begun "reducing future orders and current inventory levels" in response to slowing sales. Reports from auto dealers indicated continued pressure on sales because of higher interest rates, historically high vehicle prices, and an ongoing lack of manufacturer incentives. Industry contacts generally expected consumer spending to remain soft in the coming months.

Overall demand for manufactured goods was relatively stable. Demand remained strong for aerospace-related products and heavy trucks and trailers, and some manufacturers reported benefitting from an increase in international orders. Multiple contacts reported that slower end-market demand had resulted in fewer orders for their products as their customers sought to rein in inventories. One manufacturer indicating weaker demand said that customers were still "working off excess inventory stockpiled during pandemic." On balance, however, manufacturers expected demand to remain stable in the months ahead.

Demand for residential construction and real estate stabilized, and contacts attributed this stabilization to the arrival of spring and to flattening interest rates. One homebuilder indicated that potential homebuyers had been afraid that rates would continue to rise before they could close on a home, but the recent stabilization of rates had helped to increase activity. A couple of homebuilders reported an increase in speculative construction projects because many individuals want to purchase and move into homes immediately, in part to avoid further rises in interest rates.

Nonresidential construction and real estate activity softened on balance. One general contractor noted that clients have started to "put the brakes" on projects because of high interest rates and general economic uncertainty. Several commercial real estate brokers also noted that elevated interest rates were negatively impacting leasing activity. However, a contact who specializes in industrial space indicated there had been an increase in construction activity from manufacturing clients in recent weeks that he attributed to an uptick in reshoring projects.

Overall, loan demand continued to decline this reporting period. Bankers posited that increased interest rates along with economic uncertainty contributed to a slowdown in borrowing from households and businesses. One lender suggested that small businesses were beginning to use available cash in lieu of borrowing because of high rates. Delinquency rates remained low; however, one banker indicated that he expected delinquencies to increase in coming months. Core deposits continued to decline for a variety of reasons, most notably because of deposit-rate competition. Looking forward, bankers expected loan demand to weaken further in the coming months.

Nonprofit contacts indicated that housing affordability remained a challenge and had recently worsened for low- and moderate-income households. Contacts cited rising housing costs, low inventory, and purchases by institutional investors as factors contributing to the affordability issue. A community stakeholder reported that two outside investors purchased more than 500 units of affordable housing in one community, and the residents, all of whom were low-income tenants, were asked to vacate the property with minimal notice. Another contact reported that all-cash transactions limited access to first-time homebuyers, particularly those looking to purchase homes in lower-priced markets. To help counter these trends, one public agency acquired more than 190 properties from a private investment company and was recently working with renters to keep the units as affordable housing.

Economic activity in the Fifth District was little changed, on balance, in recent weeks. Manufacturing activity was unchanged as new orders from retailers softened while orders from industrial clients were strong. District ports saw a moderate decline in total volumes as import activity fell; however, export volumes held strong. Trucking firms also reported declines in demand and shipping rates and put a pause on hiring as a result. Retail spending declined slightly overall, although some goods categories saw gains. Consumer spending on travel and tourism, on the other hand, increased moderately. Residential real estate activity picked up slightly amid historically low levels of existing home inventory. New home sales slowed, however, and builders offered incentives to close deals. Commercial real estate activity declined modestly, but some segments such as medical, industrial, and retail leasing remained strong. Overall, loan demand declined across commercial loan types, deposit levels declined, and delinquencies rose but were still near historically low levels. Meanwhile, nonfinancial services saw modest growth in demand and steady revenue growth. Employment rose modestly amid a tight labor market; however, wage growth moderated. Inflation remained high despite a slight slowdown in the pace of price growth in recent weeks.

Firms continued to grow their employment levels modestly over the most recent reporting period. Several firms reported having multiple open roles they were not able to fill due to a tight labor market. A textile manufacturer was struggling to hire the "next generation" of workers to replace retiring workers, as the average age of new hires is in the fifties. Many other firms, on the other hand, were adequately staffed and held employment levels unchanged. Firms reported already having gotten through their large wage increases and are feeling okay with the current level of moderate wage growth. A craft beer manufacturer reported that wage growth, although still somewhat high for the skill set of workers, has stabilized from last year.

According to our surveys, year-over-year growth in prices received by services slowed slightly while growth in prices received by manufacturers was little changed. In both sectors, price growth remained well above historical levels. A small appliance manufacturer, however, said that costs had fallen as shipping costs from China returned to pre-covid levels. As a result, combined with pressure from big box retailers that were looking to cut prices to consumers, the firm was lowering its prices.

A steel manufacturer increased the frequency and amount of bonus payments to maintain a stable workforce. New orders, on balance, were down compared to the previous reporting period. Several contacts reported that their clients had excessive inventory, resulting in lower levels of business. Contacts reported that retailers have "right sized" their inventory levels, resulting in new orders returning to pre-pandemic levels.

Fifth District ports reported a moderate decline in loaded import volume this period. Imports of consumer goods and automobiles were down. However, with the growth of investments in manufacturing, there was an increase in imports of machinery and parts. Loaded export volumes were strong and mainly driven by agricultural products and lower value commodities, as well as rolling stock. Container dwells have shortened dramatically and there were no issues with empty containers causing backups at the port. Spot rates were low relative to the last two years, but transatlantic spot rates are still slightly above their pre-pandemic level mainly due to some blank sailings and carriers removing capacity. There was a return of some purchasing power back to the shipper.

Trucking firms reported a sharp decline in freight volume this period with excess capacity in the system. Respondents indicated that there was a freight recession, and it was more difficult to find loads. Weakness in demand was primarily in consumer and industrial segments. Spot prices have declined primarily due to more price sensitivity by shippers and competition for freight. Consequently, trucking firms stated that they had implemented a pause in hiring and were anticipating decreasing the number of drivers by attrition. Trucking firms also said that the supply chain had improved with better availability of equipment and parts.

Residential real estate respondents indicated that the spring market was off to a good start with sales prices continuing to appreciate but not at the same pace as last year. Inventory of homes for sale remained constrained due to a fewer people putting their homes on the market after locking in a low interest rate during the pandemic. Buyer traffic was steady and days on market increased slightly in the last month. However, fluctuations in mortgage interest rates caused buyers to pull back, with pending sales and closed sales both down this period. Builders were offering strong incentives to close deals. Some residential renovation firms noted a steady decline in closing sales due to the cost of those services and the consumer's lack of funding.

Workforce training providers and banking contacts who serve low- and moderate-income individuals continued to see signs of declining household financial conditions. Regional bankers observed that consumer financial stress had intensified from a period of higher savings as delinquencies returned to pre-pandemic levels. While some employers noted slightly lower staff turnover, workforce development contacts affirmed that workers continued to leave jobs in search of higher wages to offset rising expenses, especially housing. Others said workers continued to report a need to work from home to cope with household demands. Some owners of small businesses who previously relied on traditional banks for loans, faced credit constraints, leading them to turn to Community Development Financial Institutions for financing.

Housing demand throughout the District remained strong despite interest rate and home price volatility. Though below year-ago levels, home sales in many markets increased on a monthly basis as buyer sentiment modestly improved. The supply of existing homes for sale remained low as homeowners showed increased hesitancy to list homes for sale, especially if they had financed at a low interest rate. Home prices remained down from peak levels but have recently shown month-to-month improvement. New home builders have responded to inventory shortages by increasing speculative inventory production and some have begun to reduce buyer incentives.

Commercial real estate (CRE) conditions were mixed. The industrial sector remained healthy, while office, multifamily, and some segments of retail, slowed. Some contacts reported increasing expenses, especially property insurance, as an area of heightened concern. An increasing number of contacts reported worries about the availability of financing as some lenders reduced funding commitments and increased underwriting standards. Most CRE contacts noted increasing uncertainty and declining property values as a significant industry headwind.

Demand for transportation services softened, on balance, over the reporting period. Trucking contacts noted significant year-over-year declines in freight volumes and revenue amid what some referred to as a "freight recession." Activity in the warehousing sector remained robust; however, warehouse development transaction volumes fell substantially. Ocean carriers reported lower container import volumes as retailers worked to deplete elevated inventory levels. Inland barge companies reported stable demand. Transportation contacts' outlooks were mixed, but several downside risks were cited, including the potential for weaker consumer spending, rising interest rates, and persistent inflation.

Liquidity remained a top concern for financial institutions over the reporting period. Continuous variations in interest rates, along with some deposit flight to higher-yielding alternatives, put stress on liquidity. Financial institutions reported that the fair value of securities portfolios continued to stabilize but unrealized losses remained elevated compared with pre-pandemic levels. District banks also reported ongoing commercial real estate loan growth, albeit at a slower pace. Shifts in commercial real estate property values raised additional concerns about increasing credit risk as financial institutions began reevaluating the collateral values of underwritten loans.

Economic activity in the Seventh District was little changed overall in April and early May. Contacts generally expected slow growth in the coming months, though many expressed concerns about the potential for a recession over the next year. Employment increased moderately; nonbusiness contacts saw a small increase in activity; consumer and business spending were flat; and activity decreased modestly both for manufacturing and for construction and real estate. Prices and wages rose moderately, while financial conditions tightened modestly. Expectations for farm incomes in 2023 decreased some.

Prices rose moderately in April and early May, and contacts expected a similar rate of increase over the next 12 months. Producer prices increased modestly, with contacts highlighting higher costs for some raw materials and for energy. However, several contacts said that growth in many raw materials prices had slowed. In addition, a number reported that increases in shipping costs had slowed noticeably, particularly for trucking and ocean freight. Consumer prices generally increased due to solid demand and the passthrough of higher costs. That said, a retail industry observer said price growth was moderating across categories.

## Category: Consumer Spending
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from April 11, 2023 to May 22, 2023.
Consumer spending was unchanged on balance over the reporting period. Nonauto retail sales were flat, as strong demand for essentials was offset by relatively weak spending on discretionary items. For example, contacts highlighted solid demand for groceries and household items, but lower sales of furniture and jewelry. Unseasonably cool weather reportedly hurt lawn and garden sales. Light vehicle sales increased slightly. Several vehicle dealers said that high prices were putting a damper on demand. Leisure and hospitality spending fell slightly—notably sales at restaurants were down—but overall activity remained at a high level, with contacts reporting strong spending on cruises and at travel agencies.

Transportation demand edged down, and one contact noted that truck freight activity had slowed enough that some trucking capacity was no longer on the road. Demand for industrial, commercial, and residential energy decreased slightly. Inventories for most retailers were a bit above desired levels. In manufacturing, inventories stayed slightly elevated, and many contacts indicated that they were no longer experiencing supply chain disruptions.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from April 11, 2023 to May 22, 2023.
Construction and real estate activity declined modestly on balance over the reporting period. Residential construction activity was down modestly. Contacts reported that high interest rates had led some projects to be postponed or cancelled, and that while construction costs had fallen, the decline wasn't enough to offset higher financing costs. Contacts in the multifamily sector were more sanguine, noting that many projects were moving forward despite tighter financial conditions. Residential real estate activity decreased modestly. Prices and rents declined, and contacts said that the low inventory of homes for sale helped prevent larger declines. Nonresidential construction moved down slightly, though warehouse building remained a bright spot. Contacts also noted that school construction was robust, supported both by American Rescue Plan funding and the passage of state and local referendums. Commercial real estate activity decreased moderately, with contacts pointing to high interest rates as a key factor behind the slowdown. Prices and rents were down, and the availability of sublease space increased. However, there were reports of rising retail rents in some areas because of a lack of high-quality new construction.

Manufacturing demand decreased modestly in April and early May. Manufacturing backlogs were down moderately, and inventories were slightly elevated. Contacts reported fewer supply chain problems, though some items were still difficult to find. Steel orders increased slightly. One contact noted that steel service center inventories were low, in part because high interest rates made it expensive to hold inventory. Fabricated metals orders were down modestly, with contacts pointing to the aerospace and construction sectors as reasons for the decline. Machinery sales were down slightly, and contacts also cited weaker demand from the aerospace sector. Auto production was steady on balance.

Business loan demand was flat overall, though one banking contact noted that clients manufacturing or selling discretionary consumer items had increased their credit line utilization in response to lower demand. Loan quality deteriorated some, but a few contacts noted that delinquencies remained below pre-pandemic levels. Business lenders reported slightly tighter standards, while borrowers said that credit conditions had tightened moderately. In the consumer market, new loan demand decreased slightly, with contacts highlighting a slower mortgage market. Consumer loan quality was flat, while standards tightened slightly.

Expectations for Seventh District farm incomes in 2023 fell some as prices for key products moved lower. Corn and soybean prices decreased, as rapid fieldwork and planting progress heightened expectations for a large harvest. Soft red wheat prices remained weak, but hard wheat prices rose due to drought affecting much of the U.S. wheat crop and uncertainty surrounding another extension of the agreement allowing exports out of Ukraine. There were lower prices for eggs and dairy products, especially cheese. Hog prices increased from a low level and cattle prices moved higher. In light of higher interest rates, contacts expected farmers to conserve working capital to minimize the need to take out farm operating loans. There were reports of slower farm machinery sales but also shortages of some types of equipment. Prices for farmland were higher again as demand remained solid and inventories of farms for sale were limited.

Community development organizations and public administrators reported a small increase in overall economic activity in April and early May. State government officials said tax revenue continued to grow but at a slower pace. Unemployment insurance claims remained low, though one contact noted a rise in claims from workers at temporary help firms. Demand for social services was elevated; contacts said that the need for food assistance had been exacerbated by the recent end of Covid-19 benefits. Tight labor market conditions were again a challenge for small businesses and community-serving organizations, as employees were reportedly willing to change jobs for modest increases in pay and were less swayed by benefit options. Elevated interest rates continued to be a factor limiting the supply of affordable housing.

Economic conditions have remained unchanged since our previous report. Contacts continued to report difficulty hiring workers, but generally had a slightly easier time finding and retaining workers. Wages and other input costs increased modestly, which led to margin compression, as firms were unable to pass on these cost increases as sales prices. Consumer spending was mixed: Some firms noted they had lowered expectations due to weaker overall economic conditions while others were limited by their ability to meet strong demand due to labor shortages and supply chain issues. The residential real estate sector was largely unchanged, but commercial real estate contacts reported softer sales and concerns over looming vacancy and debt issues. Banking contacts noted loan demand softened and delinquencies continued to tick up. Overall, the outlook was slightly weaker due to concerns about future demand and broader concerns about weakening macroeconomic conditions in the second half of the year.

Prices have increased modestly since our previous report. Half of District survey respondents reported higher or slightly higher prices since the first quarter, 31 percent reported similar prices, and 19 percent reported lower or slightly lower prices. These responses appear to be driven by increasing input costs, with over three-fourths of respondents reporting higher or slightly higher nonlabor costs and a similar share reporting higher or slightly higher labor costs. Just under half of survey respondents projected that third quarter prices will be higher than in the previous year. Respondents reported that consumers continued to become more price sensitive, which prevented businesses from fully passing on increasing costs to consumers. A contact in the automobile industry reported that wage pressures, higher interest rates, and increased inventories industry-wide have decreased profit margins. A contact in the retail industry reported softening demand due to higher prices, causing them to lower prices and decrease their margins.

General retailers, auto dealers, and hospitality contacts reported mixed business activity and a slightly weaker outlook. April real sales tax collections increased in Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas relative to March and decreased in West Tennessee. Retailers in Memphis noted that business activity met their expectations; however, they had lower expectations for future business activity due to rising interest rates and broader economic uncertainty due to the looming decision on the debt ceiling. A St. Louis auto dealer reported that business activity was relatively unchanged from the previous month and noted that they have lowered expectations for upcoming sales because they do not have enough product to meet demand. Restaurants in Little Rock that were impacted by the tornado at the end of March were preparing to start reopening. According to contacts, economic activity linked to the Kentucky Derby rose more than 10 percent from the previous year, and contacts estimated that the event surpassed pre-pandemic numbers.

The contact expressed concern that the majority of the leases on these office spaces will not be renewed. Construction contacts were most worried about shortages of labor, followed by a slowdown in demand for new projects. A majority of construction and commercial real estate contacts reported sales falling short of expectations.

Contacts expect loan demand to further weaken in the upcoming quarter and noted recent increases in consumer credit use, particularly for everyday purchases, due to higher prices. Meanwhile, high interest rates have held down demand for business credit. Contacts reported that clients have been taking distributions from their portfolios to pay off loans and avoid new borrowing. Credit standards were largely unchanged from the previous quarter, but delinquency rates saw a slight uptick, a continuation of an ongoing slow rise over the past several quarters.

Several recent surveys of various sectors and geographies all found strong recent demand for labor. Businesses expected growing demand heading into the summer season but continued to report difficulty with turnover and finding labor. However, there were also some signs of softening labor demand. In April alone, Minnesota saw almost as many mass layoff events as in all of 2022, affecting more than 2,600 workers in total, a greater number than last year.

Construction survey respondents indicated a mixed picture for materials costs, with an overall flattening in the pace of increases over the past three months. Lumber and certain steel prices decreased. Contacts in construction and agriculture reported that heavy equipment prices remained elevated despite some reduction in demand. Retail gasoline prices increased slightly since the last report, while diesel prices declined. Prices received by farmers increased from a year earlier for corn, potatoes, hay, cattle, turkeys, and eggs; prices decreased from a year earlier for soybeans, wheat, milk, hogs, chickens, sugar beets, dry edible beans, lentils, and canola.

Workers and job seekers in low- and middle-income households prioritized better pay and benefits as they looked for work, according to a recent survey. Food, gasoline, and household energy costs continued to tighten people's budgets. "Gas is rising to a point where I cannot afford it," shared a South Dakota agricultural worker. A preschool teacher reported that his paycheck was barely sufficient to pay for necessities. He and others in similar situations were looking for second jobs to supplement their incomes. Young migrant workers at a Minnesota milk factory reported working 12 hours a day and having one day off every two weeks. Their hourly wages ranged from $10 to $13 for "hard work that others don't want to do." They shared feeling as if they had no freedom because they spent most of their time working and resting for the next day.

Consumer spending rose modestly since the last report. Gross sales in April were flat in South Dakota year over year, and the Montana accommodation and lodging sector remained strong this spring. Air travel continued to grow at District airports, with several seeing double-digit passenger growth in April compared with last year. An airport contact said that leisure travel "remains very strong," adding that business travel has continued to recover. A May survey found that Minnesota restaurants continued to see strong patronage, while hotels and entertainment venues reported mostly flat revenues compared with the same period last year. Businesses were optimistic regarding the summer season, particularly among restaurants and entertainment venues. A dealership with multiple locations in the western part of the District reported that new car sales in April were 23 percent higher year over year, thanks mostly to "getting some vehicles out of railyards," but there remained significant pent-up demand.

Nonresidential construction activity was flat overall since the last report, with subsectors experiencing some variability. Firms in infrastructure and other heavy construction reported generally stronger activity, in part from federal infrastructure initiatives. Firms in industrial and commercial construction reported some softening. However, increases in project cancellations were seen across the industry, the result of high input prices, higher financing costs, and general uncertainty about the economy. New projects out for bid, as well as project backlogs, were also reported to be lower than this time last year. Smaller firms reported some unwillingness to commit to longer-term projects, or doing so only with elevated work bids, due to the volatility of material costs. On the positive side, supply chains reportedly improved overall, though they have not yet had a material effect on project completion times, in part because of labor shortages. Residential construction remained subdued. Single-family permitting in April was more than 40 percent lower year over year in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region; most other large markets in the District saw even bigger declines. Discounts have started to appear for some speculative developments. A Wisconsin homebuilder said the "majority of the work comes from people who have cash and not from people taking out loans."

Commercial real estate fell since the last report. Industrial and multifamily markets remained strong, and new construction has slowed recently in both sectors, helping keep vacancy rates low and rents healthy. Office real estate was seeing real strain from continued low levels of worker occupancy. Incentives to retain tenants were common because many were looking to downsize their office footprint. Those purchasing buildings with debt faced a tightening market for refinancing. Residential real estate remained subdued. Closed sales in April fell notably year over year across the District, with many larger markets seeing declines of 30 to 50 percent. Median sale prices declined in western and central Montana and were flat in several other markets.

District agricultural conditions were solid heading into planting season. About half of respondents to a survey of agricultural credit conditions reported that farm incomes increased in the first quarter from a year earlier. Lenders noted improvements in liquidity and in the financial condition of producers, but they were concerned about commodity price volatility and rising interest rates. Heavy snow over the winter and persistent cold weather will significantly delay spring planting in some areas, contacts reported. District oil and gas exploration activity decreased slightly since the previous report.

Minority- and women-owned business contacts reported a slight decrease in activity over the last month. Higher nonlabor input costs were narrowing profit margins for some entrepreneurs, who said that they were hitting a limit in their ability to increase final prices. Compensation was mostly unchanged and finding applicants remained a challenge for those hiring. Entrepreneurs expected to see some improvement in sales but remained wary in their profit forecasts. A contact who provides technical assistance to women entrepreneurs said she has seen an increase in demand for services, including among working mothers. She warned that higher interest rates "scare new entrepreneurs" and presented additional challenges to some who already struggled with financial literacy and access to capital.

Total economic activity across the Tenth District changed little during May. Consumer spending at restaurants and for travel picked up in recent weeks, but most contacts did not expect the surge in spending to persist into coming months. Job growth continued to slow. However, the number of job openings remained elevated as businesses indicated they recently became more selective among potential candidates. Worker retention improved substantially, supporting the more cautious recruiting practices among businesses. Prices rose at a moderate pace. Growth in housing rental rates remained elevated in several western District states, but the pace of increases declined broadly and swiftly from the growth rate experienced during the past year. Although many businesses indicated some persistence in their ability to pass on higher costs, they also reported slower expected growth in costs ahead. Corn and soybean prices declined slightly since April based on reports of ideal planting conditions throughout most states and early projections that production could hit record levels due to historically strong yields. Banking customers continued to diversify account balances among multiple banking institutions. Overall, deposit levels remained stable across the District, with continued rotation of balances toward time deposits.

Although the overall pace of hiring in the Tenth District continued to be modest, most businesses indicated they had just as many, or more, job openings over the past month as they did at the beginning of the year. Contacts indicated they became much more selective in their hiring recently even as the number of applicants increased, partly explaining the disparity between the number of jobs posted and the level of hiring. Contacts reported that worker retention improved further in recent weeks. Several businesses also noted that competition for talent from businesses in different industries became less prevalent recently. Most businesses indicated that some of the slowness in hiring activity was also due to ongoing labor shortages, particularly for skilled workers in jobs with limited education requirements.

Prices continued to rise moderately across the District. Businesses were mixed in their ability to pass along higher costs to their customers. Regardless, the pace of input price growth slowed broadly, suggesting easing cost pressures. Accordingly, most businesses indicated that price increases for finished products will likely soften over the coming year. Housing rents rose at a moderate pace generally, increasing somewhat faster in western District states. However, rents were growing much more slowly across the District than the accelerated pace witnessed over the previous year. "Since peaking in September of last year, growth in rental rates is returning to the pre-pandemic trend," one contact reported.

Consumer spending at restaurants, in hotels and at entertainment venues rose at a robust pace in several District cities over the past month. Some of this surge in spending was tied to success of certain professional sports teams, which led to inbound travel and activity for post-season games and for a highly attended player draft event. Notably, both hotel occupancy and daily rates picked up recently. However, several contacts reported that spending for personal care services continued to decline at a moderate pace.

Organizations serving low-to-moderate income (LMI) communities reported increased demand for their services compared to six months ago. The growth in demand was noted across food assistance, housing assistance, and care economy segments of the non-profit space. As consumer prices have increased, organizations noted clients were more likely to be experiencing depleted savings and high credit card utilization, suggesting LMI populations are struggling to accommodate the recent growth in the costs of living. Non-profit leaders indicated they anticipate adverse effects of tightening credit availability on the communities they serve over coming months.

Manufacturing contacts reported little change in overall production volumes. However, most contacts indicated the number of new orders and the length of their production backlogs declined modestly over the past month. In characterizing the downshift in new orders, one contact stated, "things are slowing, but no cliff in demand seems to be coming." Certain premium and specialty manufacturing activities, namely high-tech manufacturing and agricultural equipment production, reported ongoing strength in demand. The majority of contacts at manufacturing businesses indicated little difficulty in securing financing for their operations and planned capital expenditures. Services contacts broadly reported a moderate increase in business activity, with leisure and hospitality and health care establishments indicating especially strong sales growth over the past month. Although activity among services businesses picked up, expectations for growth over the next six months declined modestly. Some contacts at services businesses suggested access to credit slightly worsened over the last few weeks, primarily for funding large capital spending projects, but most businesses reported no change in their access to financing.

Several contacts in commercial real estate reported worsening conditions associated with higher refinancing costs over the past month. Heightened requirements for additional equity to reduce loan-to-value ratios were making refinancing deals difficult to close. Challenges in valuing properties reportedly exacerbated headwinds for refinancing activity. Some office property managers indicated assessing tenet quality became more difficult because the large companies that are historically stable renters have become more footloose, asking for shorter lease terms, or are reducing their demand for space altogether.

Loan demand weakened modestly in the past month as higher interest rates and the uncertain economic environment deterred loan growth, particularly for commercial real estate. Contacts expected loan demand to remain at current levels over the next six months. Rate pressures remained elevated in the deposit market. Customers continued to diversify account balances among multiple banking institutions in response to volatility in the banking industry. Overall, deposit levels were stable across the District during the past month, with continued rotation of balances toward time deposits. Given that funding costs are growing faster than new loan growth, net interest margins were projected to compress. Credit standards remained unchanged, and contacts noted stable credit quality and low past-due levels. However, contacts expected credit standards to tighten somewhat further due to concerns about future deterioration in asset quality, as higher borrowing costs adversely affect repayment capacity.

Energy activity declined slightly over the last month. Though oil production increased slightly, and natural gas production stayed flat, District rig counts declined in the face of depressed price levels. Still, there was some divergence among District states. The number of active rig counts held steady in New Mexico and Colorado but fell moderately in both Oklahoma and Wyoming. Furthermore, as an additional sign of slowing energy activity, the number of drilled but uncompleted wells continued to increase in the District and contacts expect an additional reduction in well completions going forward. Lastly, while access to credit is generally not an issue for most energy firms, companies with a heavy concentration in natural gas have seen tightening credit conditions due to sustained lower natural gas prices.

Corn and soybean prices declined slightly since April and were moderately lower than a year ago. Prices moved down recently based on reports of ideal planting conditions throughout most states and early projections that production could hit record levels due to historically strong yields. Wheat prices increased slightly since April, but poor yields caused by drought could limit revenues, particularly in Kansas and Oklahoma. Profits among cattle producers continued to be pressured by high feed costs and drought that damaged pasture conditions throughout the region.

Oilfield services firms were still hiring, though some layoffs were seen in natural gas regions. Scattered reports of layoffs also came from transportation services and manufacturing. In an April Dallas Fed survey of 370 Texas business executives, more than half were currently trying to hire. Forty percent said the availability of applicants improved over the past month, significantly higher than the 14 percent share reporting a worsening. Reports of binding labor constraints continued in the energy sector, and mentions of worker shortages came from a few other sectors as well, including healthcare and retail.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from April 11, 2023 to May 22, 2023.
Conditions in the services sectors picked up somewhat. Demand for professional services remained strong, particularly for consulting, talent acquisition, catering, and janitorial services. Providers of legal and insurance services reported mixed conditions by type of service. Contacts noted weaker demand for elective medical procedures and surgeries in recent weeks. Consumer spending on pet care reportedly increased. Major tourist hubs across the District experienced a pickup in leisure and business travel as convention attendance and international travel continued to recover. Conversely, smaller tourist destinations saw lower-than-expected traveler volumes during spring break and Easter. Activity in the entertainment and media production industries slowed significantly due to ongoing collective agreement negotiations between the major studios and writers' unions.

Manufacturing activity was robust during the reporting period. Demand was notably strong for food manufacturing, metal fabrication, and heavy machinery. Manufacturers generally reported lighter order backlogs, due mainly to softening demand. Supply bottlenecks, especially those related to ocean freight, eased significantly in recent weeks. Nevertheless, contacts continued to highlight limited availability and extended delivery times for products and equipment that rely on semiconductor chips.

Conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors weakened slightly. Reports on exports were mixed as ocean freight costs eased somewhat, while the war in Ukraine continued to contribute to shipping disruptions. Contacts in California noted that wet weather conditions lowered yields for brassicas and berries. Rains also disrupted pollination for tree and vine crops, which is anticipated to reduce yields. Seafood stocks were reportedly stable in the Pacific Northwest. Contacts noted lower costs for transportation and irrigation water and higher costs for other inputs such as for packaging, fertilizer, and energy.

Activity in residential real estate slowed further over the reporting period. Contacts across the District reported stable demand for single-family homes, although high mortgage rates restrained prices. Inventories of existing single-family homes were low, and owners appeared hesitant to forego their existing low-rate mortgages. Asking rents were largely stable, and one contact in Southern California noted that new multifamily construction put downward pressure on rents in some areas. Despite reported improvement in the availability and cost of materials, construction of new homes was flat to down as developers responded to higher financing costs.

Conditions in commercial real estate were weaker overall. In the face of changing workplace needs, leasing activity for downtown office space remained weak, and new office construction stalled. Demand for retail and industrial spaces remained stable. Contacts around the District noted that plans for new projects stalled, which has led to more competitive construction bids.

Conditions in the financial sector changed little over the reporting period, and uncertainty remained high. Contacts cited higher interest rates, tighter lending standards, ongoing uncertainty in the banking sector, and lower overall confidence as the main dampeners of activity in the sector. Depository institutions mentioned tighter competition for deposits. Lending institutions observed reduced demand for residential loans and uneven demand for commercial loans. Contacts reported that recent stresses in the regional banking sector negatively affected access to credit, particularly for smaller businesses. Reports also noted increasing delinquencies in consumer loans, including for auto and credit card debt.

## Overall Economic Activity: 
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from May 23, 2023 to June 30, 2023.
Overall economic activity increased slightly since late May. Five Districts reported slight or modest growth, five noted no change, and two reported slight and modest declines. Reports on consumer spending were mixed; growth was generally observed in consumer services, but some retailers noted shifts away from discretionary spending. Tourism and travel activity was robust, and hospitality contacts expected a busy summer season. Auto sales remained unchanged or exhibited moderate growth across most Districts. Manufacturing activity edged up in half of the Districts and declined in the other half. Transportation activity was down or flat in most Districts that reported on it, as some contacts reported reduced demand due to high inventory levels and others noted continued challenges from labor shortages. Banking conditions were mostly subdued, as lending activity continued to soften. Despite higher mortgage rates, demand for residential real estate remained steady, although sales were constrained by low inventories. Construction for both residential and commercial units was slightly lower on balance. Agricultural conditions were mixed geographically but softened slightly on balance, with some contacts expecting further softening for the remainder of 2023. Energy activity decreased. Overall economic expectations for the coming months generally continued to call for slow growth.

Employment increased modestly this period, with most Districts experiencing some job growth. Labor demand remained healthy, though some contacts reported that hiring was getting more targeted and selective. Employers continued to have difficulty finding workers, particularly in health care, transportation, and hospitality, and for high-skilled positions in general. However, many Districts reported that labor availability had improved and that some employers were having an easier time hiring than they were having previously. Employers also reported that the unusually high turnover rates in recent years appear to be returning to pre-pandemic norms. Wages continued to rise, but more moderately. Contacts in multiple Districts reported that wage increases were returning to or nearing pre-pandemic levels.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from May 23, 2023 to June 30, 2023.
Prices increased at a modest pace overall, and several Districts noted some slowing in the pace of increase. Consumer prices generally increased, though reports differed in the extent to which firms were able to pass along input cost increases. Contacts in some Districts noted reluctance to raise prices because consumers had grown more sensitive to prices, while others reported that solid demand allowed firms to maintain margins. Input cost pressures remained elevated for services firms but eased notably in the manufacturing sector. Freight rates continued to decrease, along with the prices for many construction inputs, though concrete prices increased. Price expectations were generally stable or lower over the next several months.

The Fourth District economy was generally stable in recent weeks as high interest rates continued to constrain households' big-ticket goods purchases and businesses' project plans. Bankers and transportation firms cited these effects as contributing to weaker demand for their own services. Nevertheless, contacts were generally more optimistic about the near-term outlook and less concerned that a U.S. recession would occur in 2023.

Business activity expanded at a slight pace in recent weeks, with modest increases in employment and roughly even prices. Consumer spending increased by a small margin, as retail sales increased modestly and tourism was flat. Manufacturers reported mixed results but sales growth was moderate on average. Software and IT services firms enjoyed stable demand and modest revenue gains. Residential home sales increased slightly in May from the previous month but remained below seasonal norms. Commercial real estate markets weakened further, with abrupt declines in life sciences leasing and financial distress showing up for office properties. The outlook was mostly optimistic among contacts outside of real estate. Residential real estate contacts expected sales to remain muted and commercial real estate contacts braced for declines in activity and property values moving forward.

Employment increased modestly and wage growth continued to moderate as labor market imbalances eased further. Among retail and tourism contacts, labor demand remained healthy but showed signs of moderating, and there were modest improvements in the available labor supply. Some airline contacts continued to struggle to fill positions but said that hiring and training were underway to improve the situation. A clothing retailer noted that it had taken several months to fill 200 warehouse jobs, but they were nonetheless able to fill all positions. Following two summers of worker shortages on Cape Cod, some restaurant and hotel owners there have achieved efficiencies enabling them to operate with a smaller staff. In manufacturing, the labor market remained tight, although contacts said that it had improved over last year, and headcounts increased modestly. Headcounts at software and IT firms were up slightly, and hiring plans were mixed. Contacts noted that turnover had either stabilized (albeit at above-average rates) or decreased in recent months, and reductions in turnover and absenteeism reduced the need for hiring at some firms. Wage pressures were described as stable or, in most cases, declining, as wage growth rates continued to fall back to more moderate levels.

Manufacturing contacts reported a very benign pricing environment, with one even mentioning the possibility of deflation. Prices were slightly higher among IT contacts, but with no further price increases anticipated. Hotel room rates in Greater Boston increased in excess of seasonal patterns, rising 12 percent on a year-over-year basis. Cape Cod rental prices increased yet again, but at a much more modest pace than in recent years. The outlook called for further moderation of pricing pressures moving forward.

First District retail contacts reported a modest uptick in sales relative to earlier this year, while tourism contacts saw mixed results that were about flat on average. A clothing retailer enjoyed a slight uptick in demand this spring after a soft first quarter. Mainstreet retailers on Cape Cod experienced a strong start to the high season, but hospitality contacts on the Cape said that occupancy rates for hotels and especially short-term rentals were down by modest to large margins from their record highs of the past two years, though still above 2019 levels. Airline passenger traffic through Boston further increased in recent months, reaching 96 percent of pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023, and international passenger traffic alone reached 99 percent of pre-pandemic levels, although travel to and from Asian markets remained depressed. The Greater Boston hotel occupancy rate increased relative to seasonal trends, with occupancy climbing ever closer to 2019 levels. Scheduled convention activity and cruise bookings for the remainder of the year are set to increase further, exceeding 2019 levels.

Manufacturing contacts were generally positive, reporting moderate gains in sales on balance. A pharmaceutical company reported lower sales that were nonetheless in line with their expectations, owing to increased competition from generics. A frozen fish producer said that sales were down year-on-year due to higher prices. Other contacts reported very strong sales. A furniture producer recorded its best second-quarter results ever, up markedly from a weak first quarter. A semiconductor manufacturer said that, despite an industrywide slump, their own sales were up 12 percent from a year earlier, an outcome attributed to the firm's heavy exposure to the automotive industry and the transition to electric cars. One contact said they had revised their capital expenditure plans to take advantage of tax credits, although this mostly involved moving existing projects forward rather than adding investments. The outlook was positive across the board. The semiconductor manufacturer in particular expected that 2024 would bring demand increases linked to upgrades of phones and PCs as well as from the diffusion of AI products.

Contacts in IT and software services posted modest revenue gains on average, and demand was steady over the first two quarters of 2023. Profits and margins were up slightly, although Q2 expenses increased above expectations at one firm. Capital and technology spending was unchanged or down somewhat. One firm expected to slow its capital spending further moving forward amidst an ongoing transition to the cloud. Outlooks were generally optimistic, with expectations of ongoing stability in demand. One contact expressed confidence that their business would hold up well moving forward even if the broader economy turned down. However, one contact was concerned the presidential election might disrupt the stability of the business environment.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected from May 23, 2023 to June 30, 2023.
Commercial real estate activity in the First District was moderately weaker in recent months. Office leasing was stable or down slightly, with very few leases signed. Office rents were roughly stable and vacancy rates were said to be either flat or rising slowly. A contact in Connecticut reported a high-quality urban office building being forced into foreclosure due to tenants giving back space upon lease expiration. Life sciences leasing activity slowed dramatically, a fact attributed to the drying up of venture capital and other funding sources to would-be tenants. Contacts reported a somewhat quieter industrial market than in the past two years, although industrial rents remained high and vacancy rates historically low. Grocery-anchored retail continued to perform well, but other retail vacancies ticked up due to the failure of some non-grocery chains. Across sectors, contacts' expectations turned more pessimistic. High borrowing costs are expected to continue to deter investment, sales, and construction. Multiple contacts expected the market to fare better in New England than in other regions of the country, but nonetheless expected activity in the region to slow and property valuations to fall accordingly.

First District home sales increased a bit in May from the previous month on average, and some areas reported a healthy uptick in activity, but May's sales were nonetheless described as weak relative to historical norms. Across markets, home sales continued to post very steep declines on a year-over-year basis, for single-family dwelling as well as condos. According to contacts, activity was held back yet again by further declines in inventory (on a year-over-year basis) and persistently high mortgage interest rates. High rates also exacerbated the low-inventory problem, as current homeowners were reluctant to swap their existing, low-rate mortgages for higher-rate loans, leading to fewer homes going up for sale. Despite tepid sales, the dearth of inventories relative to demand meant that prices continued to rise, even as the pace of appreciation slowed gradually in recent months. Median prices for single-family homes rose modestly relative to May 2022, by six percent or less depending on the area. However, median condo prices increased by double-digit margins in some states, as buyers priced out of the single-family market looked increasingly to condos. Contacts expected no meaningful changes in market dynamics until interest rates declined.

Economic activity in the Second District stabilized in recent weeks following a period of moderate weakness. Labor market conditions were strong, with ongoing modest employment gains and steady wage growth. Inflationary pressures eased as both input and selling price increases slowed noticeably. Supply availability continued to improve, particularly for manufacturers, and manufacturing activity edged slightly higher. Consumer spending grew steadily and tourism in New York City remained strong. While housing markets were solid, exceptionally low inventory remained a challenge and there were some signs of a pullback in demand in parts of the District. Commercial real estate markets remained mostly unchanged, with persistently high office vacancies. Conditions in the broad finance sector continued to deteriorate, though at a more subdued pace than in recent months. Regional banks reported ongoing declines in loan demand, tighter credit conditions, and narrowing loan spreads. Looking ahead, businesses expect economic conditions to improve, though optimism remained muted.

On balance, employment increased modestly, though there were stronger gains reported by personal service providers and wholesalers. While firms in the construction sector reportedly shed workers, layoffs generally remained concentrated in large firms outside of the region. A contact from the Adirondacks reported that J-1 visa seasonal workers have arrived following a pandemic pause, providing a much-needed seasonal boost to the strained workforce as the tourism season gets into full swing. Though it has become slightly easier to hire, finding skilled workers remains a major challenge.

Further, attrition rates have continued to fall at many businesses and are in some cases below normal levels, reducing the need to hire replacements. With signs that the labor market may start to cool, some employers are beginning to require workers to come to the office more often. Indeed, a New York City employment agency focused on financial services noted that roughly half of open roles were now fully in-person.

Still, the high cost of many inputs remains a major challenge for businesses in the region. The pace of selling price increases also moderated, especially among goods producers and retailers, though businesses in leisure & hospitality noted growing price pressures in travel services and entertainment. Manufacturers generally expect continued easing in price increases in the months ahead, while firms in the broader service sector anticipated more persistence.

Consumer spending grew steadily in the latest reporting period. Consumers have continued to shift their spending away from goods toward experiences, such as travel, entertainment, and restaurants. Indeed, amid higher prices and changing preferences, department store contacts reported sagging sales. Increasingly discerning shoppers eschewed purchases of seasonal items in favor of high-quality basics during a cool spring season, leaving an inventory surplus of certain summer wear. Still, auto dealers in upstate New York reported that new car sales have been strong as pent-up demand has been satisfied by ongoing improvements in inventory, while used car sales remained subdued.

Tourism activity remained strong in New York City and is on track to reach pre-pandemic levels this summer. The recent air quality problems from wildfire smoke had only minor effects on tourism, with the biggest blows to outdoor attractions. The recovery of business travel has been slower, hindered by a shift to virtual events and a budget-driven reduction in attendance at in-person meetings.

While the home sales market has remained solid, there has been some cooling in parts of the District. In particular, demand softened in much of upstate New York as discouraged buyers frustrated by low inventory increasingly stepped aside. Meanwhile, home sales markets in and around New York City remained resilient as potential buyers were undeterred by low inventory. Home prices were steady to up slightly; bidding wars were common across the District, though at reduced intensity.

Residential rental markets have continued to firm, as a strong economy and relatively high mortgage rates have continued to boost demand by pushing some potential homeowners into the rental market. In New York City, vacancy rates were below historic norms and rents reached new highs, and rents also edged up in much of upstate New York.

Commercial real estate markets were mostly unchanged. Office vacancy rates held steady at elevated levels across the District and rents were mostly flat, though some businesses reduced their footprints and opted for higher-quality office space. Of note, the prolonged weakness in office markets has begun to spillover to architecture and engineering firms, who noted negative impacts on business activity. New York City's retail market was flat, with no change in vacancy rates, rents, or leasing activity in recent weeks. By contrast, vacancy rates remained at low levels in the industrial market and rents trended up modestly, except in northern New Jersey, where vacancy rates increased somewhat.

Conditions in the broad finance sector continued to deteriorate, though at a more subdued pace than in recent months. Small to medium-sized banks in the District reported ongoing declines in loan demand across all loan segments. Credit standards continued to tighten for all loan types, loan spreads narrowed, and deposit rates moved higher. Delinquency rates edged up. Contacts cautioned that the average loan-to-value ratio on outstanding used car loans has risen to about 120 percent, presenting potential risks to the auto finance market.

Community leaders expressed concerns about the inadequacy of the region's mental health care system. Contacts expressed the need for supportive housing units that are integrated with social services and medical support for addiction treatment and mental health care. Non-profits reported working with hospitals that own large real estate portfolios to develop sites for middle-income and supportive housing, though elevated construction costs and strained supply chains have hindered progress on this front.

On balance, business activity in the Third District continued to decline slightly. Consumer demand appeared to tick down as contacts detailed more cautious spending habits by consumers, including fewer visits and smaller purchases. High interest rates are continuing to limit listings of existing homes for sale, which has helped new home builders. Employment fell slightly despite improving labor availability. Wages and prices continued to grow at a modest pace. Firms also continued to indicate that wage and price pressures were subsiding. Overall, contacts reported relatively few supply chain disruptions – instead noting that the costs of many of their supplies had stabilized. Contacts continued to note tighter credit standards, although credit quality remained good. On balance, expectations for economic growth over the next six months remained subdued, as both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms expected slight growth.

Employment appeared to decline slightly after rising slightly during the prior period. Although contacts noted relatively few cases of broad-based layoffs, they detailed targeted layoffs, more selective hiring practices, and fewer hours for employees. Of the firms looking to hire, most reported that hiring continued to be easier as labor availability improved. However, firms noted that shortages remained for certain positions, especially housekeeping staff and cooks in the leisure and hospitality industry and skilled trade workers in the construction and manufacturing industries.

In our monthly surveys, nonmanufacturing firms reported decreases in both full-time and part-time employment. The index for full-time employment in the nonmanufacturing sector turned negative and fell to its lowest level since June 2020. The share of nonmanufacturing firms that reported a decrease in the number of full-time jobs rose to over 25 percent. Manufacturing firms reported mostly steady levels of employment as nearly three-quarters of the firms reported no change in jobs. Staffing firms confirmed that the demand for labor declined from the prior period and that clients were no longer looking to immediately fill all open positions.

Tourism contacts continued to report slight growth – noting that the recovery was slowing. Business travel continued to recover, but leisure travel was flattening. Multiple contacts reported that the amount of money guests spend at their leisure destinations declined modestly in recent months. Despite the slowing recovery in tourism in the region overall, one contact highlighted that May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.

Real estate brokers reported that inventories of existing homes for sale remained very low because homeowners have been reluctant to give up their low mortgage rates. Existing-home sales rose slightly in the current period but remained well below the sales observed in prior years during the normally busy spring housing market. Homebuilders once again described their modest sales as better than expected, and noted the industry continued to benefit from the dynamics of the existing-home market.

Overall, Fourth District business activity changed little since the prior reporting period. While consumer spending on services remained solid, higher interest rates continued to constrain households' big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, several contacts suggested that higher interest rates led many businesses to delay projects. Accordingly, bankers reported lower loan volumes for both household and business loans. Manufacturers reported little growth in orders, but many continued to work through solid backlogs. Contacts have recently become more optimistic about the near-term outlook for their firms, and many have lowered their expectations for a US recession in 2023. Still, uncertainty remained elevated and was likely reflected in cautious capital spending plans and slower employment growth. Wage pressures continued to ease somewhat as labor demand lessened and labor availability improved for many firms. Input cost pressures also eased, and the share of firms reporting increased selling prices dipped to its lowest level since late 2020.

Contact reports suggested modest employment growth in the Fourth District during the most recent reporting period, with demand for labor varying by industry segment. Demand was particularly strong among manufacturers that continued to report solid backlogs for their goods. Still, a few manufacturers (and contacts in other industries) reported that they were only hiring to fill key production positions while leaving others unfilled (such as those in support). The hesitance to fill support roles was mainly a function of general economic uncertainty or expectations for weaker demand for goods and services.

On balance, wage pressures eased slightly during this reporting period, with the share of contacts holding wages steady (67 percent) at its highest in more than two years. Some bankers, transportation firms, and restauranteurs reported that they did not need to increase wages because workers were more readily available. By contrast, several manufacturing and construction firms reported that wage pressures remained high amid continued difficulty filling key openings.

Construction contacts noted that steel and lumber prices were falling but concrete prices were rising. On balance, these contacts suggested that costs were "stabilizing." Manufacturers reported meaningful relief from input cost increases, as well, with one plastics manufacturer stating that suppliers were raising prices less often and by a smaller percentage than in the past. Looking forward, contacts expected further relief from nonlabor input cost pressures.

Price pressures eased, as well. Less than 40 percent of firms recently raised selling prices, the lowest share recorded since the end of 2020. Several goods producers raised prices to maintain margins or to "catch up" to past cost increases. However, many also said they did so cautiously. One manufacturer said it couldn't raise prices "without hurting demand or damaging customer relationships." Similarly, a logistics contact noted that customers were increasingly resistant to any price increases and that freight prices fell further. Consumer prices continued to increase on balance, but one discount retailer said that its prices eased somewhat as it passed along "the disinflation…seen from some suppliers."

Consumer spending was mostly unchanged. Warmer weather and resilient consumers bolstered sales for restauranteurs and some non-auto retailers. Still, one large general merchandiser noted that household budgets had tightened because of reduced SNAP benefits and high inflation. He added that sales for discretionary items, such as televisions and video game systems, had declined and that some customers had begun to choose less expensive store-brand food items over national brands. Some auto dealers said that sales rebounded despite higher interest rates, while others stressed that interest rates and elevated vehicle prices remained the primary deterrents for potential customers. Contacts generally expected consumer demand to hold steady in the coming months.

However, orders softened or remained weak for some firms tied to consumer products as inventory corrections continued. Steel manufacturers said that orders were steady or slightly lower compared to those in recent months, and industry contacts generally expected demand for their products to pick up in the second half of July following an expected seasonal slowdown earlier in the month. Likewise, manufacturers across industry segments were notably optimistic and expected demand for their products to increase in the coming months.

Lenders reported weaker activity amid economic uncertainty and higher interest rates. Loan demand decreased, with declines noted for both household and business lending. One banker said that many businesses were putting projects on hold because of economic uncertainty unless the project is being subsidized by the government. On the funding side, deposits were generally flat to down as banks continued to face competition for deposits, particularly from entities such as money market funds. On balance, delinquency rates remained low by historical standards and were little changed in recent weeks, with one lender describing the delinquency rate environment as "benign." Looking forward, lenders expected further declines in loan volumes and little change in deposits.

Demand for nonfinancial business services generally declined recently. Contacts in professional and business services noted that demand had flattened. Transportation services firms reported declines in activity, in large part because firms continued to work down inventories, some of which had been built up as a hedge against supply chain disruptions earlier in the recovery. Looking forward, firms in professional and business services generally expected demand to rebound in the months ahead. By contrast, logistics and freight contacts anticipated further declines, though one freight contact was optimistic that "the bottom is in the not-too-distant future."

Community organizations reported a sharp increase in the number of families seeking food assistance recently, with one noting that it had seen a 35 percent jump since March. Multiple contacts said that the loss of pandemic-era Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in March, along with elevated food prices, contributed to the increase. One food pantry operator said, "people are experiencing food insecurity more now than I have seen in my seven years with the organization." Some organizations were forced to limit the frequency of visits and quantity of food provided to households, exacerbating the strain on struggling families. Looking forward, some contacts expected food insecurity to rise further during the summer as families whose children received free and reduced lunches during the school year seek additional support.

The Fifth District economy grew slightly in recent weeks. Retailers and food service companies saw steady to increasing consumer spending, particularly for seasonal goods. Auto sales, however, were down slightly and inventory levels remained very low. Travel and tourism picked up, but travel shifted more towards larger city and international travel. Nonfinancial services firms reported stable demand, but some noted that clients were holding back capital due to economic uncertainties. Manufacturing activity slowed as new orders declined. District ports echoed that sentiment and noted that imports slowed as retailers and manufacturers still had elevated inventory levels. Loaded exports, particularly agriculture products, remained strong. Trucking firms also reported lower freight volumes this cycle. Residential real estate conditions softened as activity was still being restrained by a lack of available inventory. Commercial real estate markets were mixed as retail and industrial segments remained strong but multifamily activity leveled off and office vacancy rates rose. Commercial loan demand softened while consumer loan demand was little changed. Employment picked up moderately and wage growth eased slightly but wage pressures remained elevated amid a continued tight labor market. Price growth continued to ease but remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic inflation rates.

A software company reported that finding IT workers at reasonable rates has become easier. Conversely, a company that offers tour bus vacations struggled to find drivers and mechanical technicians, which was keeping them from operating at a higher level. Wage growth eased somewhat but there were some reports that wage pressures remained high. One contact, for example, reported that they were closely monitoring inflation and trying to adjust wages to ensure they were providing a living wage for their staff while remaining competitive in the market.

Services firms also saw price growth moderate slightly in June, but the annual growth rate remained just above five percent. A few businesses remarked that the increased cost of capital was driving up their expenses and they were increasing their prices as a result. However, some added that they were not able to push the full cost through to customers, so margins were tightening.

Fifth District manufacturing firms reported some slowdown in business activity during the most recent reporting period. Firms reported that rising interest rates and a pullback in consumer spending on goods led to declines in new orders. A dental laboratory reported not meeting their numbers for the past six months due to a significant slowdown in the dental market.

Fifth District ports stated that loaded import volume was down this period, but that volume was close to pre-pandemic levels. Many big retailers still have elevated inventory levels causing a decrease in imports of consumer goods. However, there was a slight increase in imports of machinery and parts. Loaded export volumes were strong mainly driven by agricultural products and lower value commodities. Spot prices remained low though still slightly higher than in 2019. Container dwell times shortened dramatically, and gate turn times were not an issue. In the last month, airfreight was soft compared to recent years but still above 2019 levels and was driven primarily by imports as exports were down drastically.

Trucking firms reported that shipping demand remained soft this period as customers were still dealing with elevated inventories and reduced orders. However, food and pharmaceuticals shipping volumes were holding up well. Spot shipping rates were at low levels as there was a lot of excess capacity in the truck load segment. However, respondents indicated that they were able to get moderate increases with their contract rates despite customers being very price sensitive. Companies stated that drivers were more readily available. Trucking firms also remarked that the higher labor costs, as well as dramatically higher costs of parts and new equipment, were impacting profitability.

Residential real estate respondents indicated that the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained with contract prices continuing to appreciate slightly. Overall, the number of sales decreased primarily due to the low housing inventory as well as the usual seasonal slowdown. In the last month, buyer traffic was steady and days on market continued to be low. Prospective buyers were not having any difficulties obtaining mortgages but there were some issues with appraisals not coming in at the escalated sales price. Residential construction firms noted a decrease in demand for their services as homeowners were less willing to plan for large remodeling or constructions projects.

Overall market activity in the commercial real estate sector was mixed in the last month. Leasing remained strong for retail and industrial properties with rents escalating this period. In the office market, vacancy rates and space available for sublease increased due to companies downsizing. Rental rates in the office segment remained flat; however, landlords were offering more discounts and/or concessions to potential credit tenants. In multifamily, lease rates were starting to flatten out. Respondents stated that tighter credit availability was starting to negatively impact investments into new projects. Commercial contractors noted a continued lack of skilled labor, and also that the amount of work out to bid has slowed substantially.

The majority of Sixth District contacts reported that labor availability and retention improved, and most firms continued to hire. However, challenges filling corporate roles, skilled construction, and healthcare positions were noted while, for some firms, entry-level hourly service roles were easier to fill. A number of manufacturers remained extremely short-staffed and utilized overtime to run at capacity, while other manufacturing firms reported stabilized employment levels and reduced overtime to align with softer demand. Among those firms experiencing weaker demand, most remained reluctant to lay off staff that they had endeavored to attract and retain, but several slowed the pace of hiring except for exceptional candidates or relied on attrition to shrink their workforce.

Crops were behind normal growing progress. Expectations for this year's corn crop worsened more than for soybeans because corn is more sensitive to drought at this growth stage. Crop prices were volatile during the reporting period; while corn prices ended down, soybean prices were up, and wheat prices were about the same. Some input costs were lower. Prices for milk were down once again, extending losses for dairy farms. Although hog prices moved up some, producers continued to struggle to turn a profit. Egg prices edged up. Cattle prices made further gains, as drought limited water and forage availability, forcing farmers to trim their herd sizes.

The same contact reported decreasing consumer demand and increasing consumer price sensitivity. A contact in the car industry plans to increase prices, but at a slower rate than before in order to maintain competition in the market. Other contacts reported little to no increase in non-labor cost pressures. A contact in the furniture industry reported that prices may decrease in the future after recouping previous losses from excess freight costs.

Two furniture manufacturers in Lee County, Tennessee, added 130 new employees, with an increased payroll of $4.5 million. Firms remain optimistic that demand will remain consistent at least in the near term.

Contacts reported that labor shortages have constrained public transit in St. Louis, leading workers to look for alternative transportation options. A Louisville contact reported continually improving conditions in the transportation sector. Little Rock contacts reported that rising healthcare costs and labor shortages have put a strain on the industry. The Little Rock bicycling industry has seen significant growth in recent quarters, generating more than $150 million in total economic impact from jobs to tourism to taxes. A St. Louis workforce contact reported an increase in informal childcare providers offering small-scale services.

Banking conditions in the District have remained stable since our previous report, even as lending activity continues to soften. Year-over-year loan volume declined moderately. Contacts reported that small business lending in particular has been slow, due to higher interest rates. Total deposits growth, on the other hand, has seen a strong increase since the past quarter. Rising deposit interest rates continue to create a very competitive market for deposits, which is compressing net interest margins. Customer concerns regarding deposit safety remain relatively low in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Although delinquency rates have continued to rise toward pre-pandemic levels, contacts maintain a positive near-term outlook on credit quality. A retailer reported that credit card usage has risen sharply over the past few months, bringing credit utilization to its highest levels since 2019.

District agriculture conditions declined moderately relative to the previous reporting period. Between the end of May and end of June, the percentages of corn, cotton, rice, and soybeans rated fair or better saw slight to moderate decreases across the board. Compared with this time last year, overall crop conditions have declined moderately. Crop conditions both began lower and decreased more over the period when compared with this time last year. With the exception of cotton, which increased modestly, all other individual crop conditions were worse compared with last year. Contacts in the Little Rock region reported some anxiety about the expiring farm bill later this year. While commodity prices remain high generally, some have begun retreating while input and fuel costs remain high, leading to profitability concerns as we enter the second half of the year.

Employment grew moderately since the last report. Labor demand remained high overall, in part because of normal seasonal increases, according to internal surveys and most contacts. Labor availability remained tight, but improved according to some contacts, which had upsides for both employers and workers. A Minneapolis workforce development contact noted an increase in layoffs, but so far they "haven't seen these layoffs turn into dislocated workers" because the workers "are doing OK finding new jobs on their own." Employers also continued adjusting their business and labor models. A restaurant in central Minnesota reported that it bought an apartment building to provide workers with nearby housing. A North Dakota staffing firm noted that demand for contingent work had fallen because "most clients just want full-time help," and available workers preferred full-time jobs to temporary work. Counter-intuitively, he said, "if the economy softens, we expect demand for temp staffing assignments to increase."

Half of firms responding to the Minneapolis Fed's annual professional services survey reported that the prices they charged to customers had increased from a year ago, and nearly two-thirds said their nonlabor input costs increased. Manufacturing and other contacts reported that freight rates had declined substantially from a year ago. "It feels like our vendors are squeezing the last increases out of us," said a manufacturer. Retail fuel prices in District states were little changed since the previous report. Prices received by farmers increased in May from a year earlier for barley, chickpeas, potatoes, hay, cattle, and turkeys; prices decreased from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, milk, hogs, chickens, eggs, dry edible beans, lentils, and canola.

Most workers who responded to a recent Minneapolis Fed survey reported job stability. About a fifth were looking for a different job in hopes of increased income but were facing difficulties in hearing back from employers or finding a job that paid enough. A few professional workers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area said they were considering a temporary move out of state to work remotely while their company's work-from-home flexibility was still in place. According to a Minnesota union contact, recently certified nursing assistants were choosing to work in retail instead of health care, where wages were similar but stress was much higher. A significant number of nurses were reportedly pulling back from traveling jobs as federal funding abated, and some hospitals offered up to $15,000 after taxes for an 18-month commitment to permanent positions.

Consumer spending was flat overall since the last report. Gross sales in South Dakota and Wisconsin have softened for several consecutive months year over year, and retail contacts have also reported lower sales. Tourism contacts were generally upbeat about overall activity levels but noted some pullback in travelers' average spending. Accommodations and lodging tax collections in Montana remained strong, and lodging sources reported strong bookings for the summer. Airline travel has continued to grow, though monthly increases have moderated a bit at some airports after steady double-digit gains. Recent new-vehicle sales have increased notably at some dealerships, thanks to stronger inventory from vehicle makers. Used car sales, however, have fallen. Sales of recreational and powersport vehicles improved with warmer weather but remained soft year over year.

Construction activity was slightly higher since the last report. Construction firms overall reported growth in recent revenues, with expectations of further growth this summer. Industry data and contacts suggested that infrastructure and energy sectors were seeing stronger activity than other subsectors. But inflated material costs continue to be a drag. A pavement source in Minnesota noted that the sector was slower than expected; public funding for construction projects has been "eaten up by inflation." Reports of project cancellations also continued across different subsectors. A general contractor in northeastern Minnesota said, "We are busy but there appears to be less opportunities than usual for this time of year." Several contacts noted that subcontractors remained busy, but projects tended to be smaller jobs. Residential construction remained low but there were modest signs of improvement in single-family permitting in some markets.

While contacts still perceived prices as being high, they expected prices would remain flat in the coming months. Hospitality and retail business owners were still able to pass higher costs down to consumers but were skeptical of their ability to continue doing so. Demand for workers was strong, and the ability to hire remained challenging. While some contacts were making downward revisions to their planned capital expenditures because of higher interest rates, many others were reportedly moving forward with investing. A supplier of restaurant equipment shared that demand was even higher this year among minority-owned restaurants because they tend to rely less on financing.

The level of economic activity across the Tenth District changed little during June, with a mix in performance across segments. Although hiring remained flat generally, expected employment levels at most businesses continued to point downward. Businesses predominantly reported relying on natural turnover and attrition to reduce their headcounts, rather than layoffs. Consumer spending rose, but at a more moderate pace after surging in recent months. Homeowners in several District states indicated that recent changes to tax assessments of their homes increased their monthly housing expenses, which could persistently impair their ability to spend on more discretionary items. Concerns about the adverse effects of higher financing costs on credit quality were pervasive, spanning consumer segments, commercial real estate, and small businesses. Energy activity in the District decreased significantly as weak oil and gas prices continued to squeeze profitability. Oil and gas contacts noted that capital expenditures are down from this time last year and further declines are expected, despite steady access to credit. Expectations that dry conditions will reduce crop yields pushed several commodity prices higher, but contacts noted that lower production could still limit revenues for many producers.

In contrast, services contacts reported a slight increase in hiring driven by steady consumer spending. Despite the more sluggish pace of hiring recently, wages continued to grow moderately driven largely by still-tight labor conditions for services firms.

Although the level of hiring was mostly unchanged, expectations for job growth and labor utilization over the next 6 months continued to soften. In fact, contacts generally expected a slight decline in their employment levels over the coming months and are reportedly already reducing hours worked. When asked, the overwhelming majority of contacts indicated they are not yet planning to layoff workers to reach a lower headcount. Instead, they indicated plans to post fewer positions and pause hiring activity in lieu of laying off employees. For example, one contact expressed that "pausing hiring now and relying on attrition helps to avoid harder decisions later."

Manufacturing contacts reported broad based declines, including reduced order demand and shorter order backlogs. Furthermore, manufacturing contacts expect business conditions will soften in coming months, noting continued weakening in order back logs and a further deterioration in demand. Despite softening in business conditions for manufacturing firms, business contacts expressed a continued willingness invest through capital improvement projects, albeit at a much slower pace than a year ago. Service contacts generally indicated much healthier business conditions with a moderate expansion in the demand for their services. Despite current favorable business conditions, service contacts expect a softening in activity in the coming months driven by expectations for weaking demand. Contacts in advertising and marketing were an exception, already feeling a stark pullback in customer demand. Moreover, advertising contacts indicated the onset of AI was accelerating the declines in demand for out-of-house service providers.

Contacts also noted concerns for commercial real estate (CRE) credit quality, particularly credits backed by office properties, and expected credit quality to worsen across all loan types over the next six months. Credit standards remained unchanged, though some respondents highlighted reduced risk appetite for CRE deals. Deposit balances declined in June as customers moved to competitors offering higher yields or invested in U.S. Treasuries after the resolution of the debt ceiling. Deposit insurance coverage and the desire for diversification also drove movement of large customer balances and contributed to continued tightening in banking system liquidity.

District firms reported a substantial decline in revenues, profits, and supplier delivery times since the last report. Profits and supplier delivery times are expected to continue declining over the next six months. Accordingly, District firms anticipate further reduction in activity in the near term. The average price needed for a substantial increase in drilling to occur remains above long-term price expectations for oil and gas, indicating that future production growth may be constrained for a while. Contacts noted that capital expenditures are down from this time last year and further declines were expected, despite steady access to credit.

Agricultural economic conditions in the Tenth District were steady through June. The price of most major commodities increased moderately from the previous month as drought intensified in many major crop production areas across the nation. Expectations for dry conditions to reduce yields pushed prices higher, but lower production could limit revenues for some producers. Through mid-June, an average of about 15% of corn and soybean acres and nearly 30% of winter wheat acres were in poor or very poor condition across all District states. Dry weather also continued to limit grass and feed supplies, resulting in higher costs for many cattle producers. Despite concerns about the potential for reduced profitability ahead, agricultural lenders continued to report strong credit conditions.

Existing-home sales increased, and builders noted solid demand, particularly of quick move-in or inventory homes, as buyers were hesitant to deal with the uncertainty surrounding mortgage rates. Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston were characterized as the strongest markets. Incentives such as rate buydowns remained in place, and prices were largely stable, though there were reports of increases in selected areas. Construction cycle times have improved, though a shortage of transformers was dampening completions. Builders have reaccumulated their backlogs of build-to-suit homes, and housing starts are expected to increase in the second half of the year. Outlooks remained cautious, and contacts noted tighter lending for construction and development loans.

Loan demand declined for the seventh period in a row, and most bankers expect a further deterioration over the next six months. Overall loan volumes continued to fall, with particular weakness seen in consumer lending. While commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan volumes continued to see marked volume declines, residential real estate lending remained stable. Loan nonperformance increased, with the rise led by commercial real estate loans. Credit standards and terms continued to tighten, and loan pricing continued to rise. Bankers' outlooks remained pessimistic, with contacts expecting a further contraction in business activity and an increase in nonperforming loans over the next six months.

Drilling activity for oil and gas wells declined over the past six weeks. The Eleventh District rig count fell moderately as lower prices for crude and natural gas made some projects uneconomical. Well completions were holding up better than drilling activity. Most contacts reported that tighter credit conditions since February have had slight to no impact on their firms, though a few independent producers said it had considerably reduced their ability to invest in new projects. Outlooks varied. The industry is still largely expected to increase oil-directed drilling and completion activities modestly through year end, while prospects on the natural gas side remained weak due to subdued prices.

Drought conditions eased substantially over the past six weeks, with now less than a quarter of the district in drought. Increased soil moisture broadly improved crop and pasture conditions, though heavy rains caused significant disruption to cotton planting in the Texas High Plains. A sizeable portion of cotton acreage in that area may not be harvestable this year, either because of prevented planting or crop flooding. Row crop prices generally moved up over the reporting period, and cattle prices increased dramatically, driven by steady demand for meat but reduced supplies of both cattle and beef.

Nonprofits noted increased demand for their services. Housing instability and affordability remained a top concern, and several contacts said that inflation and gentrification of neighborhoods has made housing costs, including property taxes, unaffordable for low to moderate income households. As a result, some are doubling up and living with other families in the same home. Fundraising was a challenge for some nonprofits, and a contact noted that the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds were running low. A nonprofit said age restrictions on certain program funding was making it challenging to provide services to other age groups. House Bill 8 recently passed by the Texas legislature will add about $680 million in the state budget for community colleges.

Economic activity in the Twelfth District softened modestly during the mid-May through June reporting period. Labor availability improved and overall labor market conditions eased moderately. Price increases persisted, while wage growth slowed notably across several sectors. Retail sales moderated, and activity in the services sectors eased somewhat. Demand for manufacturing goods was solid but weakened slightly, while conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors were mixed. Residential real estate activity was mixed while that of commercial real estate eased further. Conditions in the financial sector remained generally unchanged over the reporting period and lending standards continued to tighten. Communities across the Twelfth District were challenged by a lack of affordable housing and small businesses' limited access to credit. Contacts expressed concern over a weaker outlook for the economy and increased overall uncertainty.

Labor market conditions eased moderately during the reporting period. Labor availability improved, and employers across sectors reported receiving more job applications in recent weeks. Contacts highlighted that hiring for permanent, full-time positions was reportedly easier than for contract-based or part-time roles. In addition, hiring challenges persisted in health care and hospitality, where demand for workers continued to outstrip supply. Employee turnover generally improved but remained above pre-pandemic levels in retail and consumer services. Layoffs continued, albeit at a slower pace, in the financial services and technology sectors. Staffing levels in other sectors were generally steady, but employers adjusted their future hiring plans in response to overall economic uncertainty. Employers facing moderating demand favored reducing staff hours over layoffs.

Wage growth slowed notably across several sectors. Improved labor availability led to wage increases closer in line with historical rates, particularly for entry-level positions, in construction, manufacturing, retail, financial services, and technology. In contrast, contacts continued to report paying above-average salaries for experienced and skilled workers in consumer and business services. In addition to higher pay, some employers offered expanded benefits, training, and advancement opportunities to attract and retain workers.

Price increases persisted at a steady pace relative to the last reporting period. Reports noted elevated inflation across several industries and products, including utilities, insurance, used vehicles, health care, pet care, and some construction materials, such as aluminum, concrete, and electrical equipment. However, prices of some goods and services were reportedly stable or down in recent weeks, including those for gasoline, fabricated materials, and banking services. One manufacturer reported significant reductions in input costs in recent weeks but also noted not planning to lower final prices because of the cumulative cost pressures incurred over the past three years.

Overall retail sales moderated in recent weeks. Fading fiscal stimulus at the state level and reduced excess savings reportedly weakened retail spending. Consumers continued to trade down to lower cost items and reduced their spending on nonessential goods. Contacts from Hawaii and Utah indicated strong demand for retail and services supported by robust growth in tourism and population levels. Additionally, online retail demand picked up with higher sales to consumer markets in Asia.

Conditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors were mixed. Expanded ocean freight capacity and lower shipping costs supported exports, but lingering backlogs, the war in Ukraine, and a strong dollar limited access to some international markets. Domestic retail demand for agricultural products softened and demand from the food services sector plateaued. Demand for timber rose. Produce yields across the District were broadly up, recovering from the wet winter and spring. However, inventories of some foods such as raisins and nuts declined. Major seafood stocks edged up. Rising labor and insurance costs put upward pressure on production expenses, while past rains somewhat offset irrigation costs. One contact noted that ongoing capital investments helped boost productivity and curtail labor costs in the agriculture sector.

Demand for multifamily housing remained solid, though a contact in Southern California noted that it has recently taken longer to rent out apartments. Rental rates edged up. Contacts across the district reported a slowdown in new construction, particularly for single-family homes, citing uncertainty over the economic outlook and high financing costs. The availability of materials continued to improve somewhat, though shortages persisted.

Activity in the commercial real estate market was down on balance. Limited credit availability reduced demand for commercial space and curtailed construction slightly. However, contacts in Utah reported strong construction activity for industrial and retail spaces. Rental rates for industrial space reportedly plateaued, largely due to weaker demand amid ongoing economic uncertainty, while rents for retail space edged up. The office sector remained weak. One Northern California contact noted that muted brick-and-mortar sales, high operating costs, and safety concerns limited leasing demand for downtown office space.

## Overall Economic Activity: 
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected between July 1, 2023 and August 28, 2023.
Contacts from most Districts indicated economic growth was modest during July and August. Consumer spending on tourism was stronger than expected, surging during what most contacts considered the last stage of pent-up demand for leisure travel from the pandemic era. But other retail spending continued to slow, especially on non-essential items. Some Districts highlighted reports suggesting consumers may have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales did expand in many Districts, but contacts noted this had more to do with better availability of inventory rather than increased consumer demand. Manufacturing contacts in several Districts also noted that supply chain delays improved, and that they were better able to meet existing orders. New orders were stable or declined in most Districts, and backlogs shortened as demand for manufactured goods waned. One sector where supply did not become more available was single-family housing. Nearly all Districts reported the inventory of homes for sale remained constrained. Accordingly, new construction activity picked up for single-family housing. But multiple Districts noted that construction of affordable housing units was increasingly challenged by higher financing costs and rising insurance premiums. Bankers from different Districts had mixed experiences with growth in loan demand. Most indicated that consumer loan balances rose, and some Districts reported higher delinquencies on consumer credit lines. Agriculture conditions were somewhat mixed, but reports of drought and higher input costs were widespread. Energy activity was mostly unchanged during the final months of the summer.

Job growth was subdued across the nation. Though hiring slowed, most Districts indicated imbalances persisted in the labor market as the availability of skilled workers and the number of applicants remained constrained. Worker retention improved in several Districts, but only in certain sectors such as manufacturing and transportation. Many contacts suggested "the second half of the year will be different" when describing wage growth. Growth in labor cost pressures was elevated in most Districts, often exceeding expectations during the first half of the year. But nearly all Districts indicated businesses renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term.

Contacts in several Districts indicated input price growth slowed less than selling prices, as businesses struggled to pass along cost pressures. As a result, profit margins reportedly fell in several Districts.

Employment was about flat, wages grew at a modest pace, and price increases were generally small. Consumer spending on retail goods and hospitality services increased moderately. Manufacturers gave mixed results, but revenues increased at a moderate pace on average. Home sales fell further on rising mortgage rates. Nonetheless, home prices continued to climb at an above-average pace from a year earlier owing to sharp inventory declines for the same period. Commercial real estate activity was limited but stable. Contacts across all sectors expected relatively stable activity moving forward, with further easing of pricing pressures, and fewer of them mentioned the possibility of a recession when considering the outlook.

In First District labor markets, employment was roughly flat, and wages grew at a modest pace. Labor supply increased at least slightly for a diverse range of positions and many contacts said that it had become easier to fill job vacancies. Labor demand was described as steady but relatively modest in comparison with a year earlier, and contacts reported only selective layoffs. Reduced attrition also contributed to a more stable employment environment. A restaurant industry contact said that existing workers took on more shifts and more new workers were available, developments which were attributed to the looming return of student loan repayments. Contacts in multiple industries noted that enticements such as flexible arrangements and sign-on bonuses had become less common. Wage increases were modest on average, but some employers said that the pace of wage growth remained above pre-pandemic norms, while a contact in the healthcare sector said that starting wage levels were down sharply from their pandemic peaks. A workforce development contact described sustained success placing workers with physical or developmental disabilities, and expressed confidence that placing workers from non-traditional backgrounds would remain possible moving forward, even with some uptick in unemployment. Moving forward, contacts mostly expected current labor market trends to continue, with some further softening of demand possible but no major disruptions.

At Boston-area hotels, average daily room rates stabilized, rising only slightly from one year ago following several months of robust price growth. Retail sticker prices were flat but effectively down slightly because of increased promotions. Wholesale food prices for restaurants fell modestly, the first decline in several years, and menu prices were flat. Discounts on new automobiles returned as inventories approached normal levels, but prices on used vehicles remained elevated. Manufacturing contacts, with one exception, reported stable or decreasing prices, and transportation costs in particular were lower. However, one manufacturer continued to post high single-digit price increases in order to offset increases in labor and nonlabor expenses. Contacts were sanguine that inflationary pressures would continue to ease moving forward.

Among First District contacts, retail and restaurant sales increased moderately in recent months. An online retailer experienced an uptick in sales volume partially attributed to offering discounts on more products. A discount retailer saw further modest improvements in sales volumes, pointing to an improved inventory. A representative for automotive dealerships reported steady sales and improved inventories of new cars but said that inventories of used cars remained depressed. A Massachusetts restaurant industry contact reported an above-average seasonal sales uptick for July, particularly on Cape Cod and in Boston's Seaport. Nonetheless, August brought somewhat softer restaurant sales, especially in suburban areas. Occupancy rates rose modestly for Boston area hotels in recent months, but average daily room rates levelled off. Retail and tourism contacts alike had a stable outlook, cautiously optimistic for sustained modest growth for their own businesses in the near-term.

In contrast, a veterinary products maker experienced strong revenue growth in line with expectations, and a maker of leather goods reported very strong revenue growth led by online sales. Employment was stable among our contacts. One contact reported a major upward revision in capital expenditure plans, buoyed by several years of strong sales. The outlook was roughly stable or slightly improved, with most contacts at least cautiously optimistic about their firms' near-term prospects. However, some contacts cited further weakness in demand from China as a significant downside risk.

Contacts noted slight increases in labor supply and modest but steady demand for most roles. Only selective layoffs were reported. Staffing contacts enjoyed increased revenues from temporary placements, driven by elevated pay rates for such roles, which had largely evaporated during the pandemic. While most job candidates still preferred permanent, direct-hire positions, temporary roles offering higher wages were nonetheless seen as a reasonable alternative. The outlook was quite mixed and uncertain, with about flat performance expected on balance for the rest of 2023.

The commercial real estate market of the First District was described as mostly stagnant in recent months. In the office market, few leases were signed, rents were flat, and vacancy ticked up slightly from fresh sublease offerings. Multiple contacts reported strengthening demand for medical office space, however. In the industrial market, leasing activity slowed further on softer demand and very low vacancy rates, although some large new spaces were set to come online in Rhode Island. In the retail market, contacts said that grocery-anchored suburban shopping centers enjoyed decent leasing activity that outperformed expectations. Otherwise, the retail market was mixed, with flat or rising vacancy rates. Across markets, high borrowing costs continued to limit investment sales, impeding price discovery. Contacts anticipated that sales volume would remain low through at least the end of 2023. Multiple contacts expected a modest uptick in office leasing in the fall, mostly due to seasonal trends but also due to stricter return-to-office policies. The industrial market was expected to weaken further moving into late 2023.

Throughout the First District, considerably fewer single-family homes and condos were sold in July 2023 than were sold at the same time last year. A Massachusetts contact said that the state's closed sales fell abruptly in July from the previous month, owing to further increases in mortgage rates, as Boston experienced its weakest July for single-family sales since 2010. Prices increased at a solid pace from July 2022, generally rising by between 5 and 10 percent. These trends were accompanied by a substantial year-over-year drop in inventory across New England, with the sole exception of Maine, which bucked the trend and saw growth in the number of single-family homes and condos on the market. Multiple contacts pointed to high mortgage rates as a cause of these inventory constraints, mentioning that many homeowners are hesitant to sell houses whose mortgages they obtained under more favorable conditions. One Massachusetts contact suggested that state legislation eliminating barriers to construction may help to alleviate inventory challenges going forward but cautioned that any effects would likely not appear before next year.

Economic activity in the Second District held steady in the latest reporting period. While contacts noted some slowing in hiring, labor market conditions generally remained solid, with ongoing modest employment gains and steady wage growth. Inflationary pressures increased slightly after easing much of the past year. Supply availability continued to improve, though manufacturing activity contracted. Consumer spending grew steadily, led by spending on experiences, while spending on goods sagged. Tourism activity in New York City continued to grow through late summer, inching back toward pre-pandemic levels. Exceptionally low inventory continued to restrain home sales. Commercial real estate markets were mostly unchanged, with some further weakening in the office sector. Conditions in the broad finance sector stabilized following a period of pronounced weakness, though, on balance, loan demand continued to decline and delinquency rates edged up. Looking ahead, businesses have become somewhat more optimistic about the economic outlook.

Auto dealers in upstate New York reported that new car sales edged up slightly as more inventory became available. With solid lingering pent-up demand, new inventory has been turned over quickly. Even so, some auto manufacturers have continued to use targeted incentives—subsidized financing in particular—to boost sales of certain models. Used car sales increased in recent weeks spurred by softening prices.

Tourism activity in New York City continued to grow slowly through late summer, inching back toward pre-pandemic levels. While the number of travelers is nearly back to normal, tourists are substituting lower-cost experiences for premium ones — such as partaking in casual dining instead of fine dining or staying at reduced-service hotels. Meanwhile, some hotels and restaurants are making do with fewer workers by reducing service levels and business hours. Looking ahead, China's recent decision to remove pandemic-era restrictions on group travel to the United States is expected to boost tourism in New York City.

Exceptionally low inventory has continued to restrain home sales activity across the District, pushing up prices and frustrating potential buyers. With few properties to choose from, bidding wars remained prevalent in upstate New York and in the suburbs around New York City. By contrast, inventory hovered near historic norms in Manhattan, leaving buyers less pressured. Still, home prices were steady to up slightly, and affordability was at a long-time low. Contacts noted some concern that the resumption of student loan payments in October will make it even more difficult for some to afford purchasing a home.

On balance, business activity in the Third District continued to decline slightly. Consumer spending was down in most sectors, including retail, restaurants, autos, and tourism. High interest rates continued to constrain the available inventory of new homes and have also excluded many low-asset consumers from purchasing homes or cars. Employment edged up as labor availability continued to improve. Wage growth and inflation continued to subside – both continued to grow within a modest range. Overall, contacts reported far fewer supply chain disruptions and a lower (steadier) cost of goods for their inputs. Contacts continued to note tighter credit standards. Credit quality remains very good, despite a slight rise in delinquencies. On balance, firms continued to expect slight growth over the next six months – weaker than the norm for an expansionary period. Sentiment is divided. A few contacts stated that their sectors were in a recession. However, most expressed that there were no signs of a recession, and many were more optimistic for a soft landing.

On the surface, business activity in the Fourth District was little changed from that of the prior reporting period, though there were some notable shifts in industry conditions. Consumer spending softened in recent weeks after firming during the previous three periods. Similarly, demand for manufactured goods decreased slightly, a situation which many contacts attributed to continued inventory correction. Meanwhile, freight activity appeared to stabilize, though it remained weak. Nonresidential construction activity increased, and contacts reported that clients were moving ahead with new and previously postponed projects. Looking forward, contacts generally expected little change in overall business activity in the near term. On balance, contact reports suggested that employment increased slightly. Many firms reported that hiring was easier and turnover had declined. Upward pressures on wages, nonlabor input costs, and prices were relatively unchanged from those of the previous reporting period, but, in each case, these have eased considerably from those of the prior year.

On one hand, some manufacturing, construction, and freight contacts increased staffing levels in key areas to reduce backlogs, handle new projects, or meet higher-than-expected demand. On the other, some manufacturing and financial services contacts reported increased layoffs and cited tight margins and declining demand. Moreover, several firms that were trying to reduce staffing through attrition said that lower turnover prevented them from doing so; thus, they were forced to lay off workers. Several contacts noted that hiring had become less difficult. Contacts generally expected employment to continue increasing slightly in the near term.

On balance, contacts across industries noted a "leveling off" of costs. Per one construction contact, "nobody's raising prices, nobody is decreasing [them]." Some manufacturers stated that costs for many materials, such as resins, were flat, while costs for other materials, such as steel and lumber, had declined. Looking forward, contacts expected that nonlabor input cost pressures would continue to ease.

General price pressures were largely unchanged from those in the prior reporting period. However, compared to the number of contacts early in the year, a narrower set of contacts was willing (or able) to push through price increases. Many contacts reported increased price sensitivity among their clients, and some freight contacts reported increasing some price concessions to remain competitive. One freight hauler said, "Even our best customers are regularly seeking rate concessions." That said, several manufacturing and construction contacts raised prices to cover increased costs.

## Category: Consumer Spending
Period: This report was prepared based on information collected between July 1, 2023 and August 28, 2023.
Consumer spending softened somewhat in recent weeks. Goods spending remained weak amid high interest rate's dampening sales of big-ticket items and elevated price's constraining discretionary spending. Auto dealers said that sales slowed because of higher interest rates and that inventories had increased. Moreover, some said that the pent-up demand built during pandemic-era supply shortages had been mostly exhausted. A large general merchandiser noted that discretionary goods spending was down as customers continued to spend more on food and other essentials. By contrast, apparel retailers reported steady or strong sales, and one noted that back-to-school sales had increased from those of the prior year. Services spending moderated compared to that in recent reporting periods, with, for example, restauranteur's reporting generally flat sales. Looking ahead, contacts expected demand to change little in coming months.

Demand for manufactured goods decreased slightly. Some contacts reported that new orders had declined as pandemic-era supply shortages subsided and customers no longer needed to keep excess inventory. By contrast, steel manufacturers generally reported steady or increased orders following an expected seasonal slowdown spanning the first half of July. One manufacturer tied to light vehicles noted stronger orders because of increased vehicle production by auto manufacturers. On balance, manufacturers expected customer demand to remain soft in the coming months.

New home sales remained strong, though one contact suggested that construction was slowing because "interest rates have finally taken their toll" and discouraged developers from investing to create buildable lots. This contact indicated that slower construction would exacerbate an ongoing severe shortage of inventory on the existing side, something which had been constraining sales for several quarters. In the coming months, contacts generally expected demand to decline in the face of elevated interest rates and higher home prices.

Bankers indicated that higher interest rates and economic uncertainty continued to dampen loan demand from households and businesses. One lender reported that many firms were opting to "wait and see" before moving forward with projects. Overall delinquency rates remained near historically low levels, despite some bankers' reporting slight increases in delinquencies. Core deposits declined slightly as customers spent down their balances or sought higher-yield alternatives. In the months ahead, lenders expected loan demand to remain flat and higher interest rates to discourage borrowing.

However, contacts indicated that conditions stabilized somewhat compared to those in previous reporting periods and were optimistic that volumes would increase in the coming months ahead of the holiday season. Overall, professional and business service contacts reported that demand increased recently. In the months ahead, contacts anticipated that demand would be relatively flat as clients curtailed spending in the face of economic uncertainty.

Nonprofits noted increased demand for their services. For example, one entity providing mental health and addiction treatment services received 50 applications for just two openings in the program, with wait times as long as nine months. Several nonprofits said that hiring and retaining staff had been particularly challenging, and one large community service provider reported that it was 40 workers shy of its desired staffing level of 170. Contacts cited three primary reasons for the hiring challenges. First, pay rates among nonprofit entities were not competitive with those in the for-profit world. Second, limited childcare and transportation options were more likely to adversely affect workers in the nonprofit sector. Third, funders often earmarked dollars for the provision of services without earmarking accompanying funding for overhead. For example, donations to food banks were often reserved for the purchase of food, but not for the overhead associated with getting the food to those in need. One contact noted that what was needed were unrestricted funds to cover operational costs, including those for staffing.

The Fifth District economy grew slightly in recent weeks. Retailers and food service contacts reported steady to modest growth in sales, despite lower foot traffic. Auto sales were solid this period, but other consumer durables saw declines. Travel and tourism rose modestly as summer vacations were in full swing. Nonfinancial services firms noted stable demand, even with price increases caused by higher costs. District ports remarked that imports slowed as retailers and manufacturers still had elevated inventory levels. Loaded exports, particularly agriculture products, remained strong. Fifth District manufacturers reported a slowdown this period. Trucking firms reported steady, but low, levels of freight volumes this cycle. Residential real estate respondents stated that the limited inventory of homes for sale has put upward pressure on sales prices. Commercial real estate markets slowed this period; however, leasing remained strong for retail and industrial properties with rents continuing to escalate. In contrast, office and multifamily rents were starting to soften. Loan demand was stable this period despite shrinking deposit levels at banks. Employment increased modestly but at a slower pace than in previous reports. Many contacts indicated that the labor market remains extremely tight but wage growth eased slightly. Price growth continued to ease but remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Employment in the Fifth District increased modestly over the most recent reporting period but at a slower pace than in previous reports. Some contacts stated that the labor market remained tight and were doing what they can do to find employees. A recruiting agency's clients are bypassing temp-to-hire workers and just bringing them on full-time. A bearings manufacturer reported that their skilled tradesmen were approaching retirement, so the company was trying to revitalize their apprenticeship program to train young adults out of high school and community colleges. An office furniture installation company reported that when people do show-up for interviews, their wage demands were too high to match their skill set.

According to our most recent surveys, growth in prices received by manufacturers declined to an annual rate of just over three percent. Service sector price growth also eased slightly but remained more elevated at a five percent growth rate. A plumbing supply company said material costs had fallen and they were passing along those savings by lowering their prices. Several service providers noted that wage pressures eased as the availability of labor improved somewhat, which helped to slow the increases in labor costs.

A fabrics manufacturer reported that their business is volatile due to the fact that their customers do not have the confidence to hold much inventory. Finding workers remained a significant issue, and firms are finding ways to minimize costs associated with hiring. A coffee manufacturer cited that they cannot pass costs on to customers anymore and will invest in technology throughout the production process to rely less on labor.

Fifth District ports stated that loaded import volume was down but back to pre-pandemic levels. Imports were lower year-over-year but flat month over month; the decline in import volume was mainly due to a decrease in consumer goods. Exports were slowly ticking up, primarily for agricultural products, wood pulp, resins, and vehicles. Spot shipping rates decreased and were slightly lower than 2019. Carriers had reduced shipping capacity in order to maintain price. Gate turn times improved and container dwell times returned to normal levels. Demand for airfreight stabilized after declining over the last 18 months and air cargo rates dropped precipitously, but both are still above pre-pandemic levels.

However, respondents indicated that they were able to get moderate increases with their contract rates despite customers being very price sensitive. Trucking companies indicated that drivers were more readily available but that job openings for mechanics and shop staff were still difficult to fill. Firms also stated that they were experiencing higher costs of labor, parts and new equipment.

Residential real estate respondents indicated that the limited inventory of homes for sale has boosted competition among buyers and has put upward pressure on sales prices. Sellers who secured low mortgage rates have been hesitant to sell, leaving a dearth of new listings leading to a decrease in closed sales. Overall, home sales were constrained by both affordability and by the lack of inventory. In the last month, buyer traffic was lower due to the usual seasonal slowdown. Days on market increased slightly, mostly related to stale inventory. Prospective buyers were not having any difficulties obtaining mortgages. Home builders indicated that construction costs leveled off but remain high relative to pre-pandemic levels.

Overall market activity in the Fifth District commercial real estate sector slowed this period. However, leasing remained strong for retail and industrial properties with rents continuing to escalate. In the office market, companies were looking to decrease rental cost by downsizing and relocating to smaller footprints in higher quality buildings. Rental rates in the office segment remained flat; however, landlords were offering more incentives and/or concessions to potential tenants. In the multifamily sector, rents were starting to soften partially caused by a new supply of multifamily units coming onto the market. Respondents stated that some banks have pulled back on new commercial real estate lending activity and that, coupled with higher interest rates, has made deals less attractive, and in some cases, not viable.

One observation was loans were being originated for only what must be done and no more. Home equity loans and lines saw an increase in demand, with respondents noting borrowers were not keen to refinance lower rate first mortgages for their needs. Deposit levels continued to shrink, and competition for balances was still strong. Credit quality continued to be a concern as the cost to borrow increased while delinquency rates remained stable at low levels.

Construction and real estate activity was little changed on balance over the reporting period. Residential construction increased slightly overall, and contacts noted that low levels of existing home inventory were making new homes more attractive. However, some contacts saw a slowdown in multifamily construction. Residential real estate activity decreased slightly as low inventories held back sales. Contacts indicated that homes were selling quickly, and many received multiple offers. A banking contact said that borrowers they had pre-qualified for mortgages were often switching to new construction after getting frustrated searching for an existing home. Home prices and rents were up slightly. Nonresidential construction was little changed. Some contacts noted a pullback in leading indicators of future activity such as environmental studies, land surveys, and financing for speculative development. In contrast, contacts noted progress on a large number of state and local construction projects. Commercial real estate activity was unchanged. Commercial prices fell slightly and rents were down modestly in some sectors, most notably office. Contacts said many investors were holding off making commercial real estate purchases because they expected prices to fall further. Vacancy rates were unchanged.

Manufacturing demand decreased slightly in July and early August. Supply chain conditions continued to improve, though some contacts reported difficulty acquiring specialty items like industrial electrical components. Steel orders decreased modestly, in part due to weaker demand from the oil and gas and the machinery industries. Fabricated metals orders remained flat. Machinery sales decreased slightly, with contacts highlighting less demand from the auto industry. In contrast, auto industry contacts reported increased auto production despite supply chain disruptions at some plants. Several contacts expressed concerns about the potential for a UAW strike to put a hold on a large share of U.S. auto production. Heavy truck orders decreased slightly amidst moderately low inventories.

District farm income expectations for 2023 remained much lower than 2022 levels. However, reduced costs for some inputs, particularly fertilizers, boosted net income prospects for 2024. Drought concerns lessened overall, although hot weather toward the end of the period impaired development of a wide swath of Midwest crops. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices were down. Still, there were reports of a slowdown in exports as prices offered by other producers were more favorable on world markets. Hog prices moved down after hitting a seasonal peak. Prices for dairy products rose from low levels, and egg prices crept up a bit. Cattle prices increased once again, remaining one of the few agricultural prices above the levels of a year ago. Farmland prices were still higher than a year ago.

Community, nonprofit, and small business support contacts reported little change in economic activity from a robust level. State government officials saw slowing growth in tax revenues and a small increase in demand for unemployment insurance. Some small business lenders noted a slowdown in loan demand, which they attributed to economic uncertainty. Nonprofit contacts continued to experience challenges with wage competition from private sector employers, as well as an increase in other operational costs. Nonprofit organizations also said high demand for services was straining efforts to respond to elevated levels of food insecurity.

Period: This report was prepared based on information collected between July 1, 2023 and August 28, 2023.
Many businesses are aiming to maintain prices despite increasing input costs. The main reason for this is softening demand and increased price sensitivity from consumers. A respondent from a niche import business reported that despite an increase in freight costs, they could not fully raise prices because of falling sales. Another contact in the restaurant industry reported that although credit card transaction costs increased, they have not raised prices in order to stay competitive. More broadly, a regional survey reported that two-thirds of consumers delayed or did not buy a purchase because of higher prices. Some industry contacts reported steady overall demand, with consumers making substitutions for cheaper items. Others, such as a tourism contact from Northwest Arkansas, saw no immediate effect on demand after increasing prices.

District general retailers, auto dealers, and hospitality contacts reported mixed business activity and a slightly negative outlook. July real sales tax collections increased in Kentucky, Missouri, and Western Tennessee relative to the previous month and decreased in Arkansas. Retailers in St. Louis noted consumers have been watching their spending and switching to lower-quality and less-expensive goods. A Louisville auto dealer reported both new and used high-end vehicles are seeing a slowdown in demand due to affordability issues. This has been most prominent with full-sized pickup trucks and used vehicles over $25,000. District restaurant contacts noted mixed business activity over the past few months, with inflationary pressures still impacting consumer spending at all restaurants. Little Rock hospitality contacts noted a rebound in corporate travel. They also reported that the strong demand for tourism is mainly driven by high-income visitors and a drop in low- and middle-income visitors.

Manufacturing activity growth has decreased slightly since our previous report. Firms in both Arkansas and Missouri have reported slight decreases in new orders and production, but moderate increases in inventories. Lingering supply-chain issues and elevated prices on raw inputs continue to be an ongoing issue for manufacturers, though they have continued to improve in recent months. Firms are struggling to entice new workers, in part because of the increased availability of remote work in other industries. On average, firms reported they expect slight decreases in production, capacity utilization, and new orders in the coming quarter.

A Little Rock transportation contact reported high demand for air travel. A contact in the Memphis transportation industry reported issues with shipping and rising concerns about an upcoming recession due to growing warehouse inventories. Overall, sales and sales expectations for services contacts were generally about the same or slightly lower across all regions. An education provider reported low school enrollment. A St. Louis childcare provider reported that sales met expectations, but higher costs contributed to a worsening outlook. A St. Louis healthcare provider is planning to expand facilities with a new medical office building.

Banking conditions in the District have remained stable since our previous report. Overall and credit card loan demand decreased slightly from the previous quarter, while commercial, industrial, and mortgage loan demand all decreased moderately. Contacts across the District reported tightening liquidity and profit margins due to the ongoing pressure to raise deposit rates. Delinquency rates continued to climb to pre-pandemic levels and are being closely monitored by banking contacts. One contact pointed to rising cost of living as a potential driver of the increase in consumer delinquencies. Overall, however, banks continue to report solid credit standards and quality, with little past-due loans, collections, foreclosures, or charge-offs.

Corn and soybean ratings both decreased more significantly during the summer months, sustaining their fall below 2020-2021 levels the previous year. District contacts described feeling the effects of extreme weather and increased interest rates in the form of higher input costs. On net, contacts indicated a slight decline in dollar value sales and an increase in inventories.

Employment grew slightly since the last report. Hiring demand fell but remained at healthy levels. Most employers, even small ones, were hiring in some capacity. But the share of employers looking to add full-time workers dropped, and total job openings were moderately lower; very few firms reported that they were cutting workers. A South Dakota utilities company noted that it "was hiring positions deemed critical to day-to-day business operations. All other discretionary positions are on hold." Labor supply was improving, but applicant quality was still poor, with some exceptions in higher-skill areas. A Montana staffing contact noted that clients were asking for fewer workers, in part because "they know we don't have 10 [good] candidates. They are doing more with less labor, and forgoing growth." Larger employers reported having more success in adding workers, likely because they also reported stronger increases in compensation.

Wage pressures were flat but ongoing wage growth remained above average. A recent survey found that 60 percent of employers raised wages by 3 percent or more over the last 12 months, roughly in line with wage increases reported in January. However, respondents expected future wage growth to fall moderately. A northern Minnesota workforce contact said, "Wage offers have stabilized in the last three to six months. Many have stopped additional wage increases as it does not seem to be effective in getting and retaining employees."

More than two-thirds of respondents to a recent survey said that it had gotten harder to pass their increased input costs on to customers since the beginning of the year. A regional manufacturing survey indicated nearly flat wholesale prices in July from a month earlier. A third of hospitality survey respondents reported that their prices charged to customers increased by 5 percent or more over the past year; contacts in the industry reported significant continued pressure on food prices. Retail fuel prices in District states increased briskly since the last report. Prices received by farmers increased in June from a year earlier for barley, chickpeas, potatoes, hay, and cattle; prices decreased from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, milk, hogs, turkeys, chickens, eggs, dry edible beans, lentils, and canola.

A labor contact in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan shared that many police officers and nurses were choosing predictable schedules over the highest wages available when changing jobs. "They prefer balance and flexibility in their lives," the contact said. According to a Minnesota contact, nearly half of clients at a coworking space chose to work there rather than at the company office or at home "because they prefer the flexibility and autonomy." According to a Minnesota labor contact, financial incentives offered by employers were having diminishing effects as they tried to attract new workers.

Consumer spending was slightly higher overall since the last report, with some variability. Retail contacts across the District reported that recent sales were a bit slower overall compared with the same period last year, and they expected the trend to continue over the coming quarter. Hotel bookings in Montana in July were higher than a year ago, but some tourism contacts there suggested that the pandemic boom in outdoor tourism was slowing. Minnesota hospitality and tourism contacts reported that recent sales were up slightly overall, and tourism traffic in Michigan's Upper Peninsula has also been strong compared with last summer. Passenger traffic at regional airports saw continued growth. New-vehicle sales have risen thanks to increased vehicle inventory. A dealership with multiple locations saw new-vehicle sales in July rise by almost half compared with last year; used-vehicle sales have slowed somewhat as a result. Recent recreational vehicle sales remained slower across the District compared with last year, but sales of powersport vehicles have rebounded.

Construction activity was flat since the last report. Construction contacts across the District reported mixed sales activity, with notable shares seeing either increases or decreases compared with last summer. In some cases, decreases stemmed from lack of labor. Industry data showed that the value of construction starts in the District in July was similar to the previous two years, without factoring in inflation. Among sub-sectors, office construction remained moribund, and multifamily construction was also experiencing softer activity. Firms serving infrastructure markets reported stronger activity, likely due to increased federal spending. Single-family residential construction saw modest improvements in a few markets; Minneapolis-St. Paul saw a 10 percent increase in single-family permits in July year over year. Across the District, hiring remained robust, supply chains improved, and prices for materials were easing but still high.

Office vacancy rates have stabilized somewhat, but at high levels; industrial vacancy ticked higher but remained at healthy levels. Residential real estate remained soft, with year-over-year July sales falling in most markets, often by double digits. Several contacts said demand was higher than indicated by sales and attributed much of the slowness to very low inventories of homes for sale.

Economic activity across the Tenth District was stable over the past two months. After falling from high rates of growth during the first half of the year, manufacturing production and sales at service businesses stabilized in July and August. Contacts indicated the recent pickup in growth was not due to increases in demand, so much as a greater ability to meet existing orders as delays along supply chains were resolved. Accordingly, job growth was flat across the District. Despite several months of subdued employment growth, wages continued to grow at a robust pace through August, exceeding historical norms and most businesses' expectations. Consumer spending continued to expand at a moderate pace, with robust leisure travel offset somewhat by tepid retail sales growth. Several contacts suggested consumers have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. Bankers noted pockets of deterioration in some consumer loan types as delinquencies rose, with further deterioration expected for consumer borrowers. Prices increased at a moderate pace in recent months, a noticeable reduction from the pace of price increases witnessed over the last year. Though slower, growth in input prices still outpaced selling prices for most firms, compressing profit margins.

Most Tenth District contacts reported employment levels were unchanged in recent months. Labor markets remained tight with many businesses reporting ongoing difficulties hiring and retaining skilled workers, partially contributing to the slowdown in hiring activity. Both services and manufacturing businesses indicated modest improvements in expected employment growth over the next six months. These expectations were based on a better outlook for recruiting workers, rather than a desire to open more positions and recruit more workers.

However, these contacts also suggested the "second half of the year will be different," renewing their expectations for softening of wage growth they reported in early 2023. Most contacts indicated they expect more moderate wage increases of less than 5 percent over the next year. Manufacturing contacts, in particular, reported a stark shift in wage expectations, with over two thirds of respondents downshifting their expectations to more modest wage increases.

Both manufacturing and service contacts reported compression in their profit margins in recent months, as businesses were unable to pass all their higher costs onto customers. Expectations are for continued margin compression in the coming year, but at a slower pace than witnessed in recent months.

Contacts across District states reported robust growth in leisure travel at both drive-to and fly-to destinations. Despite healthy tourism activity, contacts reported growth in retail sales has not been as robust. In several states, retail spending declined slightly, with contacts suggesting consumers have exhausted their savings and are relying more on borrowing to support spending. New auto sales increased a bit due to slightly more available inventory.

Housing providers faced more difficulty building new, and maintaining existing, affordable rental properties because of substantial increases in financing and insurance costs. In Colorado, property insurance premiums reportedly rose as much as 30-50 percent over the last year, due in part to increased weather-related claims. Contacts reported some optimism in being able to help low- and moderate-income households with homeownership, using state and philanthropic funds for down payment assistance and rate buy downs. However, evictions and foreclosures continued to rise, and recently reached or exceeded 2019 levels across District states. A non-profit in Kansas City noted calls for housing and utility assistance were up 21 percent and 12 percent, respectively, over the previous six months and up 30 percent from 2019 levels.

After declining for several months, manufacturing production and sales at service businesses stabilized in July and August. Contacts indicated the recent pickup in activity was not due to increases in demand. Instead, business reported a greater ability to meet existing orders, as delays along supply chains were resolved. As existing orders were met, businesses indicated that backlogs and inventory levels declined significantly over the past two months. Contacts expressed mixed views on investments plans. Falling profit margins and shorter backlogs led many businesses to pull back on capital expenditures. Some contacts also noted securing financing for equipment and transportation vehicles was more difficult. Still, many businesses reported increasing investment activity in recent months and had plans to raise their investment spending over the next six months.

Demand for housing continued to exceed available housing supply across the District. Contacts noted several changes in the composition of home buyers in recent months. First, fewer institutional investors bought homes recently. Investor-buyers were more likely to own a small number of properties. Second, fewer buyers were willing to purchase homes that required significant improvements. Financing for home renovation typically requires licensed contractors perform the work, rather than owners' "sweat equity." The combination of skilled-labor shortages and higher financing costs reportedly deterred renovation activity on newly purchased homes. Third, investor-buyers were much more likely to 'flip' refurbished homes, rather than hold and rent them, due to higher interest expenses.

Loan demand weakened further during the last month as bankers stated high interest rates and economic uncertainty resulted in a cautious approach for prospective borrowers. Contacts noted pockets of deterioration in some consumer loan types as delinquencies rose, with further deterioration expected for consumer borrowers and across the commercial real estate (CRE) industry. Several contacts also stated that credit standards for CRE loans had tightened in light of reduced risk appetite and expected deterioration in credit quality. Deposit levels stabilized during the last couple of months, while the funding mix continued to shift from checking accounts to time deposits, driving up overall bank funding costs.

Tenth District energy activity remained steady through August. Though oil prices rose, total oil production and rig counts in the District were essentially flat, as global oil consumption slightly underperformed a majority of District firms' expectations. The number of active gas rigs decreased slightly, and production stagnated because drilling for gas remained unprofitable for District firms. Well completions leveled off from recent declines, keeping the number of drilled-but-uncompleted wells unchanged. Accordingly, District energy employment ticked up only slightly, but still lagged pre-pandemic levels. Coal production in Wyoming increased moderately as regional prices remained above historic levels.

The farm economy in the Tenth District remained strong, but conditions softened alongside lower agricultural commodity prices and persistent drought. Volatility in markets for major crops was elevated amid heightened uncertainty about supply and demand conditions. Through mid-August, prices for corn and wheat were about 10 percent lower than the beginning of the month and soybean prices also dropped slightly. In the livestock sector, cattle prices remained strong and continued to support profit opportunities, despite considerable cost pressures. Large areas of the region continued to be heavily impacted by drought that could reduce crop revenues and limit availability of feed for livestock operations. District contacts continued to highlight input costs, interest rates and thinner margins as other key concerns. Lenders indicated that credit conditions remained sound with support from strong farm finances.

The Eleventh District economy continued to expand at a modest pace overall. Solid growth was seen in the nonfinancial services sector, while retail sales were flat and activity in the manufacturing, energy, and financial services sectors declined. Housing demand was mixed, and home price increases remained subdued. Scant rainfall and very high temperatures depressed agricultural conditions in much of the district. Employment growth picked up slightly overall, and wage growth remained high. Input cost and selling price pressures were elevated in the service sector but modest in manufacturing. Outlooks were fairly stable, though uncertainty persists around the continuing impact from higher interest rates.

Price pressures remained subdued in manufacturing but still elevated in the service sector. Oilfield services firms noted some input price softening as supply chains improved. Fuel prices were up over the reporting period. Several contacts remarked that customers were more price sensitive, and an August Dallas Fed survey of more than 300 Texas business executives showed that it has become more difficult over the past three months to pass cost increases on to customers. The survey also showed that Texas businesses expect input costs to increase 4.7 percent on average this year, down from 9.6 percent increase in 2022. They expect to raise their selling prices 3.3 percent, down from 7.4 percent last year.

Texas manufacturing activity continued to contract over the reporting period, with declines seen in new orders, output, and capital spending. The weakness was broad-based but most notable in chemical, high-tech, and machinery manufacturing. Food and fabricated metals manufacturing exhibited more strength than other segments. A chemical manufacturer said construction, packaging, and industrial demand were proving anemic, and that the weak outlook for China and Europe was weighing on expected export demand. Other contacts cited higher interest rates as a headwind for capital investments and construction-related manufacturing. An August Dallas Fed survey showed that thirty percent of manufacturers saw a decrease in production as a result of the recent heat wave, largely stemming from lower labor productivity and temperature-sensitive worksites. Overall, outlooks worsened, and contacts voiced concern over the current manufacturing slump.

Housing demand remained solid for new homes due to incentives such as rate buydowns that help lower mortgage rates. In contrast, existing home sales declined due to high mortgage rates and low inventories of homes available for sale. Home price increases remained subdued. Construction for new homes increased, while multifamily construction trended down. A wave of new apartment units has caused rents to fall and vacancy rates to increase.

Loan demand declined for the eighth period in a row —now a full year —though the rate of decline eased somewhat. The pace of decline in overall loan volume also decelerated, but residential real estate loan volume declined sharply after stabilizing in May and June. Loan nonperformance continued to increase, particularly for consumer loans. Loan pricing pushed up further. Credit standards continued to tighten, though the share of bankers reporting a tightening fell to its lowest level since February. Bankers' outlooks remained pessimistic, with most expecting a decrease in loan demand and a deterioration of general business activity over the next six months.

Drilling activity for oil and gas wells declined over the past six weeks, particularly for smaller producers. The Eleventh District rig count fell moderately again, with past increases in costs and declines in prices for crude oil and natural gas making some projects uneconomical. Well completions eased but continued to hold up better than drilling activity. Most contacts expect the rig count to stabilize soon, and some expressed receding recession risks.

A significant portion of the district entered (or reentered) drought over the past six weeks due to meager rainfall and soaring temperatures. Pasture conditions deteriorated, and the weather had an adverse effect on row crops. A majority of the Texas cotton crop was rated in poor to very poor condition, and abandonment is expected to be high this year. Cattle prices rose further over the reporting period, driven by tight supply and solid demand for beef.

The scarcity of affordable housing remained the most pressing issue for lower-income individuals, according to community nonprofits. High rent and costly utilities were pricing residents out of their current living situation. Contacts lamented that high construction costs pose a major challenge for affordable housing developers building more stock. One nonprofit serving senior adults said inflation coupled with a reduction in SNAP benefits has put food insecurity as the top threat to seniors, which is a change from the usual top threats of isolation and difficulty accessing healthcare.
